# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
Scenario 1

To: Varshini, Anjana, Dithy, and Maneesha
Date: 2nd October 2025

It was the first time I had ever fallen sick while being away from home. I caught a fever and felt completely homesick. Everything around me felt unfamiliar, and I missed the comfort of being cared for by my family. However, that night, my roommates — Varshini, Anjana, Dithy, and Maneesha — showed me what genuine care and friendship truly mean.

They were quick to notice that I wasn’t feeling well. Even though it was late and everyone was tired, they immediately offered help. They brought me water, made sure I took my medicines on time, and kept checking my temperature every few hours. They even ensured that I ate something before taking tablets, reminding me like family members would.

When the fever worsened, they didn’t panic. Instead, they handled the situation calmly and informed the warden, who advised them on what to do next. My roommates stayed by my side, monitoring me through the night. Their concern made me realize that kindness can turn even an unfamiliar place into a comforting space.

That night taught me a lot about the importance of empathy. We often think of friendship in terms of fun, laughter, and shared memories, but true friendship reveals itself in moments of difficulty. My roommates didn’t treat me as just another person sharing the room; they treated me like family.

By morning, I felt much better, not only because of the medicines but because of the support I received. It was then I understood that care isn’t limited to home — it can be found wherever there are people willing to look out for you. Their thoughtful actions made me feel safe and valued, and I remain grateful for their support.

That day reminded me that home isn’t always a place — sometimes, it’s the people around us who make us feel that way.

Scenario 2

To: Security Guards
Date: 8th September 2025

When I first joined college, everything felt new and slightly overwhelming. I was still learning how things worked — where to go, what the rules were, and how to adapt to a completely new environment. During my initial weeks, the people who unknowingly helped me adjust the most were the security guards and campus staff.

One incident that stands out was when I wanted to visit the library for the first time. I wasn’t sure how to enter or whether there were specific rules to follow. I stood near the entrance, unsure what to do, while others confidently walked in. That’s when one of the security guards noticed me. He walked up with a friendly smile and politely asked if I was new. When I nodded, he patiently explained the process — how to enter, sign in, and where to sit quietly. His helpful attitude immediately made me feel comfortable.

Over time, I began noticing how the security staff contributed so much to our daily lives. They stood for hours in the sun or rain, ensuring the campus was safe and disciplined. They greeted students with kindness, guided newcomers, and were always ready to assist. These simple actions often go unnoticed, but they make a huge difference.

I have also seen them help students who lost their way, carry heavy luggage during hostel check-ins, and even ensure everyone returned safely before curfew. Their dedication creates a sense of security and warmth that makes campus life smoother.

I feel genuinely grateful for their constant support and presence. Their job might seem routine, but their attitude adds meaning to what they do. The patience and respect they show every day remind me that kindness doesn’t need recognition — it just needs sincerity.

Their quiet commitment inspires me to value every person’s effort, no matter how ordinary it may seem.

Scenario 3

To: Warden / Hostel Canteen Staff
Date: 5th November 2025

After a long day filled with lectures, assignments, and lab work, I was completely exhausted. I just wanted to grab a quick snack before heading back to my room. Unfortunately, by the time I reached the canteen, they had already started closing for the night. Seeing the stalls shut down made me feel disappointed — it had been a tiring day, and I really needed something to eat.

Just as I was about to leave, one of the ladies working there noticed me. She must have seen how tired I looked because she smiled and asked if I had eaten anything. When I said no, she quietly packed a small snack for me even though everything was officially closed. It was such a simple gesture, but it meant a lot.

That moment made me realize how small acts of kindness can have a big impact. She didn’t know me personally, and it wasn’t her duty to help after hours, but she still did it out of genuine concern. It reminded me that compassion doesn’t always come from people close to us — sometimes, it comes from those we least expect.

I also admire how hard the canteen staff and wardens work daily. They manage hundreds of students, ensure food is served on time, maintain cleanliness, and still treat everyone with patience and understanding. They play an important role in our daily comfort, yet many of us rarely express gratitude for it.

That small act of kindness from the canteen staff stayed with me. It taught me that empathy is not about big gestures; it’s about noticing when someone needs help and doing something simple to make their day better. I felt thankful not only for the snack but for the warmth and thoughtfulness behind it.
