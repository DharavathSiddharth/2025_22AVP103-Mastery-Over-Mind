# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record

SCENARIO 1

DATE: 13TH OCTOBER 2025

TO: Rajaneesh , Aparna , security guard

On 11th October, I lost my spectacles near the swimming pool area—AB3. At that time, I didn’t even realize they were missing. It was only on the 13th, two days later, that I noticed they were gone. That moment hit me hard. I felt confused and worried. I started searching everywhere I had been that day after class—IT canteen, general store, hostel rooms, and the swimming pool area again.

While I was searching near the pool gate, a security guard noticed me. He saw that I was looking for something and came forward to help. He didn’t have to, but he did. He helped me search around the area, even though we couldn’t find the spectacles. His kindness stayed with me. It was a small gesture, but it meant a lot. In that moment, I didn’t feel alone.

After that, I posted in a few student groups saying my spectacles were lost. I hoped someone might have seen them or picked them up. But no one replied. Two days passed, and still no response. I started to lose hope. I thought they were gone for good.

Then something unexpected happened. I found out that someone had actually posted a picture of my spectacles on the same day I lost them—11th October. I hadn’t noticed the post earlier because I wasn’t paying much attention. Rajaneesh from the CSE department had found them and kept them safe. Aparna, his classmate, helped me get in touch with him and collect my spectacles.

Rajaneesh didn’t know me, but he still took the time to keep my things safe. Aparna didn’t have to help, but she did. And the security guard didn’t ignore me—he offered help when I needed it most. These actions may seem small to others, but to me, they were huge. 


I want to sincerely thank the security guard, Rajaneesh, and Aparna. You didn’t just help me find my spectacles—you gave me a memory I’ll always carry. A moment where strangers showed care, and friends stepped in to help. I’ll never forget it.


SCENARIO 2

DATE: 26TH OCTOBER 2025

TO: Wardens , a unknown person who found my id card my class advisor

On 26th October, after returning to campus with my friends, something unexpected happened—I lost my ID card near the main entrance gate. I didn’t notice it immediately. It was only when I reached my room and started settling down that I realized it was missing.  I panicked. It was already hostel gate closing time, so I couldn’t go back and search properly that night.

The next morning, I went to the entrance gate and looked around the area where I thought I might have dropped it. I searched everywhere . I even asked the security guards nearby if they had seen it or if someone had handed it in. But i did not find it I knew for sure I had lost it somewhere here, and yet I couldn’t find it.  I didn’t know what to do next. So I decided to approach my class advisor and explain the situation. . He advised me to apply for a new ID card and move on. His words gave me a little comfort, even though I was still upset. At least someone was willing to help me figure out the next step.

But then, something truly unexpected happened. That same evening, the hostel wardens called me. They had found my ID card. It felt like a miracle. I went to meet them, and they handed it back to me. Yes, they scolded me a bit—for being a first-year student and being careless—but I didn’t mind. I was just so relieved and grateful that they had taken the time to contact me and return it.

I don’t know who exactly found my ID card. I never got to meet them or thank them in person. But someone clearly cared enough to pick it up and hand it over to the wardens instead of ignoring it or leaving it lying around. That small act of kindness meant the world to me.

To the person who found my ID card: I may never know your name, but I hope you know how much your action mattered. Im very thankful for your gesture.
To the hostel wardens: Thank you for taking the time to reach out to me and return my card. Even though you scolded me, I know it came from a place of care. And I’ll always remember that.
To my class advisor: Thank you for being calm and supportive when I was nervous. Even though I ended up getting my ID card back, I’m still grateful that you were ready to help me move forward.
Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart.

SCENARIO 3

TO: Nethra , dithy , tanvi , sathwika , deva dharshni , kaviya


I feel really thankful for Nethra, Dithy, Tanvi, Sathwika, Deva Dharshni, and Kaviya. These people are not just classmates or hostel mates—they are my support system. They are always with me, no matter what. Whether I’m feeling confused, lost, tired, or just not okay, they are there. I don’t even have to say anything sometimes—they just know. That kind of understanding is rare, and I feel lucky to have it.
There are many times in class when I don’t understand something. Sometimes I feel slow or unsure. But these friends never make me feel bad about it. I ask them again and again, and they explain things patiently every time. They helped me install software when I didn’t know how. They cleared my doubts, even the small ones. They repeated things for me when I couldn’t catch them the first time. And they never got irritated. They never said, “You should know this.” They just helped. That means a lot to me. It makes me feel safe to ask, and that’s a big thing.But it’s not just about studies. These people are with me in every way. They sit with me, talk to me, laugh with me, and make me feel like I belong. When I feel low or demotivated, they cheer me up. Sometimes I feel very stressed, like everything is too much. But when I sit with them, or even just hear their voices, I feel better. It’s like their energy lifts me up. I don’t feel alone when I’m with them. I feel like I have a small family here.There was a time when I felt very out of place. Everything was new, and I didn’t know who to talk to. I was scared to ask questions, scared to make mistakes. But slowly, these friends made me feel comfortable. They didn’t judge me. They didn’t laugh at me. They just accepted me. And that gave me the courage to be myself.
Even when I’m silent, they understand. Even when I’m not smiling, they notice. They ask me if I’m okay. They don’t force me to talk, but they stay with me. That kind of care is something I’ll never forget. It’s not loud or dramatic—it’s quiet, but powerful.Sometimes, I just sit with them and listen. I don’t talk much, but I feel calm. Their presence is enough. It’s like they carry a kind of peace with them, and I get to share it. That’s why I say they are my strength. When I feel weak, they make me feel strong. When I feel like giving up, they remind me why I started.I’ve had many moments where I felt like I couldn’t do something. Maybe I was stuck in a subject, or just mentally tired. But these friends didn’t let me stay stuck. They pulled me out of that space with their kindness. They didn’t give me big speeches. They just stayed with me, helped me, and made me laugh. And that was enough.

I feel really blessed to have them in my life. I don’t know how to say it in big words, but I want them to know—what they do matters. Every small help, every smile, every time they sit with me—it matters. It stays in my heart.Thank you, Nethra, Dithy, Tanvi, Sathwika, Deva Dharshni, and Kaviya. You are not just friends—you are my comfort, my courage, and my joy. I will never forget your kindness and support. You make this place feel like home. You make me feel like I’m not alone in this journey. And for that, I’m truly grateful.
