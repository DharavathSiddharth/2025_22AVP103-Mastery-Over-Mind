## Journal Record
Gratitude Journal

1.Date: Everyday

To: Maths Srinivasan Sir

I am very grateful to have a lecturer like Srinivasan sir because he always answers doubts without getting irritated and makes sure that each and every student get an idea about the topic. He doesn't get tired of teaching the same topic again and again until the students finally understand. It is a blessing to have a lecturer like him, I've seen many maths teachers but never a teacher like him. I feel bad for all those who don't get a chance to learn from Srinivasan sir. 

To show that he is the best, all i can do is study properly and get good grades, because who doesn't get good grades after learning from him. His way of teaching is very unique, he rigorously keeps teaching examples on the same problem and waits patiently until everyone understands. After each example he ask students to raise hands and explains in different method until the raised hand approximate to zero. Not only me but many people like the way he teaches, that's what makes him one of the best. Overtime I realised that showing him respect makes it more meaningful rather than just showing him the goods grades. 

moreover he even clears doubts after his period is over in his cabin. we can clearly say if a student is studying or not cause the problem is not with the teacher, we can easily identify why the students are not getting good marks if we have lecturers like him.

2. Date: Almost everyday 

To: People Working in the Mess

They regularly go unnoticed in our everyday meals, their actions blend in with our everyday meals. Human beings operating in chaos, those who repair, assist, purify, and preserve our dining spaces deserve much more awareness and gratitude than those who usually accept. This gratitude journal explores the meaningful value of accepting and appreciating such vital workers who contributes substantially to our everyday convenience and wellbeing.

Every day, they'll give a professional boost, carefully prepare a meal that feeds hundreds, if not thousands, of people. Their duty is to occupy themselves with a longer period of time than us, involving complex preparations, careful selection of ingredients, and precise cooking techniques. the physical demands of their careers are immense: standing for intervals, handling heavy equipment, traveling in a hot kitchen, and maintaining a tight health check. They are however systematic in their work, with remarkable devotion.

moreover, those human beings commonly work under difficult circumstances. Kitchen environments are very stressful, fast, demanding precise rhythms and coordination. They're managing the current army with extraordinary composure, and rarely do they receive immediate recognition for their actions. Their project requires perseverance and steadfast devotion to serve different individuals, qualities that deserve respect and apreciation

more profound understanding of mutuality is revealed when one considers their involvement. neither institution functions in isolation; the individual role or concern, by means apparently every day, is essential for the achievement of the structure.as we move forward, cultivating a heritage of genuine appreciation becomes a key task. This method is extremely difficult to systematize undervalue assistance workers, acknowledge their expertise, and understand the significant self-respect derived from their function. It requires a corporate rethinking of its perspective, recognizing that human beings are behind the support.

lastly, thanks to the mess workers should not be a polite gesture but a fundamental understanding of human values and contributions. Their everyday initiatives not only preserve our material nourishment but also contribute to our corporate social fabric. We are esteeming their commitment, confirming their experiences, and creating more compassionate, interlinked communities by extending true appreciation.


3. Date: 09/11/25

To: Nikhil 

In my view, the reference marks did not contain any explicit extra guidance. Therefore, I will continue with the default location and write a brainstorming essay according to the standard recommendations.

Reflective Essay: A Moment of Friendship and Gratitude

In the vibrant surroundings of hostel life, moments of genuine kindness are often unexpectedly apparent, highlighting the importance of companionship. My knowledge of nikhil, a fellow student who went further than his own technique in bringing biryani to our hostel on Sunday, symbolizes the current extraordinary compassion.

In addition to the monotony that regularly permeates the weekend routines in our complex housing, the day's depressing prefers different individuals. Our hostel's usual meals were uninspiring, and the student atmosphere seemed to be somewhat suppressed. Nikhil's act of generosity turned an ordinary day into a memorable meeting of friendship and appreciation.

Nikhil's resolve to venture outside the hostel and buy biryani wasn't just a way of satisfying hunger; it was a deeper understanding of communal leisure and experience. As opposed to merely eating, the intricate layer of scented rice, tender meat, and aromatic spices he had provided was more than a meal; it had been a gesture of solidarity. Every prudently organized segment indicated contemplation, demonstrating how little acts of kindness can significantly enhance interpersonal ties.

Likewise, the incident prompted me to reflect on the essence of gratitude. Communicating appreciation is not simply about admitting a particular action but acknowledging the emotional acumen and empathy that accompanied it. Nikhil's gesture was more than a physical manifestation of food distribution; it was an expression of understanding and compassion.

The biryani itself had become a metaphor for friendship , layer, and rich with a spirit. Just as a well-prepared biryani requires careful integration of various ingredients, purposeful associations require similar attention, admiration, and agreement to perceive one another.

In the end, it turned out to be a profound friendship lesson, gratitude, and human bonding. Nikhil's spontaneous act of bringing biryani to our hostel was more than a culinary transaction. It was evidence of the authority of a small, thoughtful gesture that could transform an ordinary moment into a treasured memory.

As I reflect on the present knowledge, I am reminded that true relationships are not measured by a broad statement but by an unexpected act of kindness that illuminates the beauty of human interaction. The biryani was probably consumed, but the heat of the moment was continuing to resonate, the dish as a powerful reminder of the valuable bonds that can be formed in largely unforeseeable circumstances.
