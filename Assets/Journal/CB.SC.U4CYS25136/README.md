# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
Scenario: 1 Date: August 6
Whom: Karthik

It was August 6, the day I will  remember always . It was the first day of my college life. I felt everything new and exciting. As a first-year student entering in to the campus I wondered by seeing the green environment and the campus and the mountains around campus looks beautiful ,the nature here is very beautiful I was full of curiosity and  nervousness a bit. The campus was very  big. People here are filled with new faces and voices, completely different from school life which we came across. 

When I first saw Karthik, I had no idea about him and he later become my roommate and one of my closest friends. He seemed friendly and approachable as we were the same roomates we then started talking to each other and we quickly connected by introducing about ourselves and talking about our hometowns, but soon it turned into a deep conversation. We discussed our school experiences, interests, and future dreams and realized we shared similar goals and ways of thinking. We were both passionate about learning and exploring  especially in technology, and we both wanted to achieve something big in life.TO make our parents feel proud of ourselves.

I remember that  how lucky I was to meet someone like him on the first day of my college. It felt like a sign that my college life would be so great with the people I will be  metting in here.

Later that day, I found out Karthik would also be my roommate in the hostel. I was genuinely surprised and extremely happy. I felt relieved knowing I would be staying with someone who shared similar thoughts and attitudes. The shift from home to hostel life can be tough for many students, but Karthik made it easier for me. From the first evening, we started organizing our room together. We arranged our belongings, discussed our daily routines, and planned how to manage our studies and hostel life effectively.

The next day we had an orientation our college for the first year people who came to the college we then went there and sat other in fact he helped in reaching to the place where it happened.There we say many people who came to join in this university and there saw many guest welcoming first years and addressing them about the college life and rules and regulations then they addressed about the academics by specifying the department wise and they gave clear roadmap and curriculum of our university about what we are going to study in this four years of college and then we had our lunch there and afternoon we got to visit for document verification and completed all the belongings of certificates which are supposed to submit for university management we had finished that and then we have there uniform distribution and then we took it there and we came to our hostel room. 

Over the next few days, we grew closer as we spent time in class and the hostel. We woke up early, got ready for lectures, and walked to class together. During breaks, we would sit under a tree on campus and talk about everything, from our favorite movies to our ambitions. Our conversations were full of laughter, ideas, and motivation.

As time went on, I realized Karthik was not just a good friend; he was also a great source of support. Whenever I felt homesick and any kind of fear, he lifted my spirits with his positive attitude. He has a calm and understanding nature, which makes people feel comfortable. Even in stressful situations, he knows how to bring balance and lighten the mood. Whenever I faced challenges, whether academic or personal, Karthik was the first person I turned to he helps me in each and every situation.

There were times when hostel life got tough—between the workload, late-night study sessions, and occasional misunderstandings—but Karthik’s presence made everything manageable and made me understandable. We often studied together late into the night, preparing for tests or completing assignments. Sometimes, we would sit on the terrace after dinner, and discussing our dreams.Those moments created a bond that went deeper than friendship; it felt like a brotherly connection.

One thing I admire most about Karthik is his helpful nature. He never hesitates to help others and his kind behaviour made everyone feel good about his attitude , whether it's helping someone understand a tough topic, sharing notes, or offering emotional support. His kindness has inspired me to be more  and understanding toward others  .

 We often discuss our goals, projects, and plans for the future. For instance, we talk about learning new programming languages, joining hackathons which happended in our college , and exploring career options in various fields. Whenever one of us learns something new, we make sure to share it.This mutual encouragement helps us both stay focused and motivated.

Apart from academics, we also had countless fun moments. We’ve played sports, gone for walks around campus, celebrated birthdays, and watched movies late at night on weekends. These simple moments have added joy and meaning to my college life. They’ve taught me that friendship is not just about being together in good times it’s also about supporting each other by sharing our badtimes also and we also happened through challenges together faced many problems and found the core causes for that and then we also get to know and see all the possible solutions to solve it then we choose the most efficient solution to solve this.
 

As I look ahead to the years to come, I know there will be challenges, changes, and new experiences. But one thing is certain that the friendship I have with Karthik will always remain a strong foundation in my college journey. The memories we’ve made will continue to remind me that sometimes, the people we meet by chance become the most important part of our story.

It was the day I met my best friend, my roommate, and someone who made my college life truly better.

On September 14, I had the wonderful opportunity to meet Professor Uma Maheswari , who teaches Physics in our college. I felt truly grateful for this experience because her teaching style and personality left a deep impression on me. She has a special way of making even the most difficult topics in physics simple and interesting. Her classes are always interactive and filled with real-life examples that help every student understand the subject better. During her lecture, I was amazed by the clarity and patience with which she explained every concept. Physics can sometimes feel challenging, but in her class, everything becomes easy to follow. She always encourages students to ask questions, no matter how small or basic they may seem. This open and friendly approach creates a comfortable learning atmosphere where everyone feels free to express their doubts. Her dedication to ensuring that every student understands the topic reflects her passion for teaching.After class, I had a few doubts about a topic we learned uncertainity principle . Initially, I was nervous to approach her, thinking she might be busy. However, when I went to her cabin, she welcomed me with a warm smile and kindly asked me to sit down. I explained my confusion, and she listened patiently without interrupting. Rather than giving me direct answers, she guided me step by step, helping me think through the problem and find the answer on my own. This approach made me realize the importance of understanding the concept deeply instead of memorizing formulas . What impressed me most was her kindness and encouragement. She never made me feel that my doubts were silly or unimportant. Her calm and positive attitude made learning a joyful experience. She also shared useful tips for studying physics effectively, such as relating each concept to real-life examples and practicing problems regularly. Her advice helped me change my learning habits, and I soon began to enjoy the subject more.This interaction made me feel truly inspired. I learned that a good teacher not only explains lessons but also motivates students to think independently. Professor Uma Maheswari’s dedication, patience, and love for teaching have made a strong impact on me. Her guidance has improved my confidence and curiosity toward learning physics.
I feel thankful to have such a wonderful teacher who genuinely cares about her students’ understanding and growth. Meeting her reminded me that learning becomes meaningful when guided by someone who teaches with passion and empathy. This experience made me appreciate the value of great teachers who help students grow both academically and personally.
Meeting Professor Uma Maheswari was one of the most inspiring moments of my college life. Her kind nature, clear explanations, and patient attitude left a lasting impression on me. I am truly grateful for her support and guidance, which has motivated me to study with greater interest and confidence. 


Another aspect that truly inspires me about Professor Uma Maheswari is her positive influence beyond academics. She often shares small motivational thoughts at the end of her lectures, reminding us about the importance of consistency, discipline, and self-belief she used to motive us every time by teaching some moral values and ethical values which always leads to success. Once, she told us that success in any field doesn’t come from talent alone but from daily effort and a genuine curiosity to learn and think of how much efforts we need to invest upon that work not about the result and outcomes before sincerely doing that . Her words encouraged me to change my attitude toward studying instead of feeling pressure i take as my pleasure as a student and as a son of my parents to make them feel happy .Her words inspiredc me a lot such a good teacher I started to see learning as a journey of growth. Her ability to connect moral values with education makes her not just a teacher, but also a mentor who shapes our character and mindset.
She was one of the best teachers whom I have met till now I will be thankful and grateful to study under her guidance.


Senario: 3
Date: Aug 21 
Whom: Praveen sir 
During one of the early days of my college life, in the first month of my B.Tech, I had the opportunity to interact with my class advisor, Praveen Sir. I belong to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (Cyber Security). Section B, and he is the class advisor for our section. Praveen sir is very and he used to take care and resolve problems of students of our section He patiently listens to the problems faced by the students and helps them find suitable solutions.
One day, I faced an issue logging into my university management app, so I approached him for help. He responded very kindly, guided me through the process, and helped me to resolve the issue. Whenever any student approaches him, he always responds politely and ensures that their problems are solved. This interaction made me to feel so grate towards his students.
Beyond that one interaction, my admiration for Praveen Sir grew as I saw how he handled different situations with patience and professionalism. He is not just a class advisor in name but a true mentor who genuinely cares about the academic and personal well-being of his students. Whenever our section faced issues, whether it was about internal marks, project submissions, or communication with other departments, he was always the first to step in and guide us. His calm and understanding nature made it easy for everyone to approach him without hesitation.

What sets him apart most is his friendly attitude. Many teachers keep a formal distance from students, but Praveen Sir manages to maintain respect while being approachable and easy to talk to. When he walks into the classroom, his presence brings reassurance that we have someone reliable to turn to if we face any problem. During the first few weeks of college, when everything felt new and confusing, he took time to explain how the university system worked, from checking attendance to applying for leave or accessing important notices. These small things made a significant difference for us as first-year students.

In addition to providing administrative guidance, he also offers motivational support. I remember a day when some students felt down after a tough lab session. Instead of scolding or ignoring us, he calmly spoke to us and pointed out that college life is not about perfection but about learning through mistakes. Those words stayed with me because they reminded me that growth happens through challenges. His advice often carries a deeper meaning, connecting to real-life lessons beyond academics.

Another inspiring aspect of Praveen Sir is his consistency and commitment. No matter how busy he is, he makes time to check in on his students. He often asks if everything is going smoothly, whether we are comfortable with our classes, and if we face any challenges adjusting to college life. These gestures might seem small, but they create a positive environment where students feel cared for and supported. His regular follow-ups and concern for our progress show how dedicated he is to being an educator and mentor.

I also appreciate how he encourages teamwork and communication among students. Whenever there is a class activity, he motivates everyone to participate and share ideas freely. He often emphasizes that confidence and cooperation are just as important as academic knowledge. Because of his guidance, our section gradually developed a sense of unity and collaboration. Many of us began interacting more freely and helping each other, which made our classroom environment lively and engaging.

One memorable incident occurred a few weeks after my first interaction with him. Our section faced confusion regarding the timetable and room allocation for a new lab session. Instead of letting students struggle or wait for the administration to respond, Praveen Sir personally visited the department office, clarified the details, and returned to explain everything clearly. His willingness to take extra steps for his students showed his selflessness and dedication.

Beyond academics, he often reminds us about the importance of discipline, time management, and personal development. He once told our class that technical skills are valuable, but a good attitude and character truly define a professional. Those words made me reflect deeply. Since then, I have tried to be more disciplined and responsible in my daily routine.

Overall, I have learned that Praveen Sir is not just a class advisor but also a role model who shows how a teacher’s guidance can shape a student’s mindset. His humility, patience, and dedication have had a strong impact on me. Whenever I face a problem, I remember his calm approach and try to handle things with the same level of composure. I feel truly grateful to have a mentor like him during this early stage of my college journey.
