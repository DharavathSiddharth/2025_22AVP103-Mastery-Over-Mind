## Journal Record
Scenario 1
Date: 1 day into joining Amrita.
To: My Relative
Throughout my academic journey, there have been numerous individuals who have influenced, guided, and supported me in various ways. However, among all these remarkable people, one person who has had a profound impact on me is my relative, who serves as a faculty member in the English Department of AB1. Her continuous support, insightful guidance, and sincere encouragement have played an indispensable role in helping me navigate the different stages of my educational and personal development. I owe a deep sense of gratitude to her, not only for her professional expertise but also for the warmth, kindness, and patience she has consistently shown me.

From the very beginning, when I was uncertain about the direction I wanted to take academically, she was the one who helped me find clarity. I still remember our first detailed conversation about my studies. I had several doubts about course selections, academic writing, and how to approach certain topics in English literature. Instead of giving me ready-made answers, she encouraged me to think critically and explore the possibilities myself. She would ask thought-provoking questions that made me reflect more deeply, not just about my studies but about my goals and passions. Through those conversations, I realized how important it is to approach education with curiosity and commitment. Her mentorship was not limited to the academic aspects; she also helped me build confidence in expressing my thoughts and opinions.

One of the things that stand out about her is her dedication to her students and to education in general. Despite her busy schedule as a faculty member, she always managed to find time to check on me, ensuring that I was doing well both academically and personally. She would often send messages asking how my studies were going or whether I needed any assistance with assignments or projects. These small gestures meant a lot to me because they made me feel cared for and valued. It is not common to find someone who genuinely takes the time to follow up and ensure that others are progressing well. Her consistent check-ins reminded me that I was not alone in my journey and that I had someone who believed in my potential.

Throughout the different processes—whether it was preparing for examinations, applying for academic programs, or working on research papers—her guidance was invaluable. She provided constructive feedback on my writing, pointing out areas where I could improve and offering helpful strategies to enhance my work. I particularly remember a time when I was struggling to write a research paper. I had done extensive reading but was having difficulty organizing my ideas coherently. She patiently reviewed my draft and suggested ways to strengthen my argument and improve the flow of my writing. Her comments were always precise and insightful, helping me to understand my weaknesses and transform them into strengths. I learned how to express my ideas more clearly, support my arguments with evidence, and maintain a logical structure throughout my writing. These lessons have stayed with me and continue to influence the way I approach academic work today.

Beyond the academic realm, she also guided me in developing essential life skills. She often emphasized the importance of discipline, time management, and perseverance. Whenever I felt overwhelmed by the workload or discouraged by setbacks, she would remind me that challenges are a natural part of the learning process. Her words were always encouraging, yet realistic. She never sugarcoated the truth but instead helped me see difficulties as opportunities for growth. This mindset has been incredibly empowering for me. It taught me to view failures not as the end but as stepping stones toward improvement. Her belief in resilience and continuous learning inspired me to push beyond my comfort zone and keep striving for excellence.

What makes her guidance even more special is the personal connection we share as relatives. This bond allowed our conversations to be open, honest, and comfortable. I could speak freely about my fears, doubts, and aspirations without feeling judged. She listened patiently and offered advice that was both wise and compassionate. Her ability to balance professionalism with genuine care is something I deeply admire. Even outside academic matters, she would often share life lessons, drawing from her own experiences as a teacher and a learner. She taught me that success is not just about achieving good grades but also about becoming a thoughtful, kind, and responsible person.

There were also moments when her support went beyond advice and mentorship. During stressful times, when I doubted my abilities or felt anxious about my future, she was there to reassure me. Her calm and composed demeanor had a soothing effect, and her words always carried positivity. She would remind me to take things one step at a time, to focus on progress rather than perfection. I learned from her that patience and persistence are key ingredients for success. She often told me that every effort, no matter how small, contributes to growth—and this perspective has helped me remain motivated and optimistic even in challenging circumstances.

Her influence extended beyond academics and personal development; she also played a significant role in shaping my outlook on education itself. Through her, I came to appreciate the beauty and depth of the English language and literature. She made me realize that studying literature is not merely about analyzing texts but about understanding human experiences, emotions, and cultures. Her passion for teaching and her love for literature were truly inspiring. It motivated me to approach my studies with enthusiasm and to value the transformative power of education. I now see learning as a lifelong process—an idea she often emphasized.

Looking back, I can confidently say that I would not have achieved many of the milestones I have today without her support. She has been a constant source of inspiration and guidance, someone who genuinely wants to see others succeed. I am incredibly thankful for everything she has done for me—the time she devoted, the advice she offered, and the faith she placed in me even when I doubted myself. Her mentorship has not only helped me academically but has also had a lasting impact on my character and perspective on life.

In conclusion, my relative, who is a faculty member of the English Department at AB1, has played an extraordinary role in my journey. Her guidance, encouragement, and compassion have shaped me in countless ways. She has taught me valuable lessons about education, perseverance, and personal growth. Most importantly, she has shown me through her actions what it means to be truly dedicated to helping others. I am deeply grateful for her unwavering support and for the positive influence she continues to have in my life. The knowledge and wisdom I have gained from her will remain with me always, guiding me as I continue to learn, grow, and strive toward my goals.

Scenario 2
Date: 1 week into joining Amrita.
To: All the nurses at the clinic
There are certain moments in life that remind us of the kindness and compassion that still exist in the world — moments that show us how empathy can heal not only the body but also the heart. One such experience that deeply moved me occurred during the time of Ganesh Chaturthi, when I unexpectedly fell seriously ill. What began as a normal festive season filled with joy, color, and devotion soon turned into one of the most challenging times for me physically and emotionally. I had a very high fever accompanied by severe nausea, weakness, and dizziness. My body felt heavy, my mind was exhausted, and I could barely stand without feeling that I might collapse. During that difficult period, it was the nurses at the clinic who became my true angels. Their care, concern, and selfless service left a lasting impression on me. I will always remain deeply grateful for the way they looked after me as if I were their own child.

It all started on the second day of the Ganesh Chaturthi celebration. The festive atmosphere was all around — the air was filled with the sounds of devotional songs, the fragrance of flowers, and the warmth of family gatherings. However, while everyone around me was celebrating, I began to feel unusually tired and weak. At first, I thought it was just fatigue from the excitement of the festival. I tried to ignore it, thinking some rest would make me feel better. But by evening, the fever started rising sharply, and I began to experience intense nausea. My whole body ached, and every small movement felt like a struggle. I remember lying in bed, shivering, with my forehead burning and my hands trembling.

When my family noticed that my condition was getting worse, they rushed me to the nearest clinic. I could barely walk by that time; I was on the verge of fainting. Everything around me looked blurry, and I could only hear faint voices calling my name. That was the moment I realized how fragile our health truly is — how quickly life can shift from celebration to crisis. The clinic was modest but clean, and despite the rush of patients that evening, the nurses attended to me immediately. Their calmness and efficiency brought me a sense of relief even before the treatment began.

The nurses at the clinic truly stood out for their kindness and professionalism. From the moment I arrived, they took charge of the situation with remarkable compassion. One nurse gently supported me as I tried to sit up, while another prepared the medical equipment. They spoke to me softly, reassuring me that everything would be alright. Even though I was weak and barely able to respond, I remember feeling comforted by their words and their gentle touch. In that vulnerable moment, their kindness felt like a warm light in the midst of darkness.

They quickly checked my temperature, which was alarmingly high, and gave me medication to reduce the fever and ease the nausea. One of the nurses placed a cool wet cloth on my forehead, while another monitored my pulse and checked my blood pressure. Every action they took was done with care and precision. When I started to feel dizzy and close to fainting, they stayed by my side, holding my hand and speaking to me softly to keep me awake. I could sense their genuine concern — they were not just performing their duty but truly caring for me as if I were part of their own family.

What touched me the most was the way they went beyond their professional responsibilities. They did not treat me as just another patient, but as a person who was suffering and needed comfort. One nurse stayed beside me even after her shift was supposed to end, making sure that I was stable before leaving. Another nurse checked on me several times throughout the night, adjusting my blanket and asking if I needed water. Their dedication and humanity were remarkable. Even in the midst of their busy schedules, they found time to smile, to speak kindly, and to offer small gestures of comfort that made all the difference.

As I slowly began to recover, I had time to reflect on what had happened. The fever eventually came down, and the nausea eased, but what stayed with me was the memory of how I had been cared for during those difficult hours. The nurses reminded me of what true service and compassion mean. They were not motivated by reward or recognition — their motivation came from a genuine desire to help and heal others. Watching them work so tirelessly made me realize how essential healthcare workers are to society and how much they sacrifice for the well-being of others.

During my stay at the clinic, I also observed how they treated other patients with the same level of attention and empathy. Whether it was a small child crying in pain or an elderly person needing assistance, the nurses handled each case with patience and kindness. It made me think about how nursing is not just a profession but a calling. It requires not only skill and knowledge but also a big heart. Their actions taught me the importance of empathy — that even small acts of care can make a tremendous impact on someone’s life.

When I was finally well enough to leave the clinic, I made sure to personally thank each of the nurses who had taken care of me. Words felt insufficient to express the depth of my gratitude. I told them how much their kindness meant to me and how I would never forget their compassion. They smiled humbly, saying that they were simply doing their job. But I knew it was much more than that. What they did came from genuine humanity and love for their work.

That experience during Ganesh Chaturthi changed the way I look at life and people. It reminded me that kindness has the power to heal not just physical pain but also emotional distress. When I was at my weakest, it was not medicine alone that helped me recover — it was also the warmth, reassurance, and care of those nurses. Their presence made me feel safe and gave me strength to overcome the illness. I realized how important it is to appreciate and recognize such everyday heroes who often go unnoticed.

Even today, whenever I think about that time, I feel a deep sense of gratitude. Falling sick was an unpleasant experience, but it also brought me a valuable lesson about compassion and humanity. It made me more aware of how interconnected we all are — how one person’s kindness can bring comfort and healing to another. The nurses who cared for me during my illness will always hold a special place in my heart. Their selflessness and dedication continue to inspire me to be kinder, more patient, and more understanding toward others.

In conclusion, my experience of falling sick during the Ganesh Chaturthi festival turned out to be a profound lesson in gratitude and empathy. The nurses at the clinic not only treated my illness but also restored my faith in human kindness. They cared for me like their own child, staying by my side when I was weak and vulnerable. Because of them, I was able to recover quickly and return home safely. I will always remember their gentle voices, their reassuring smiles, and the compassion they showed me. I am, and always will be, forever grateful to them for their care, their dedication, and their humanity. Their actions during that time have left an everlasting mark on my heart and continue to remind me of the extraordinary power of kindness in our everyday lives.

Scenario 3
Date: 1 month into joining Amrita
To: My Friends
Friendship is one of the most beautiful gifts that life can offer. It is a bond built not on blood, but on understanding, trust, and shared experiences. Throughout my life, I have been blessed with friends who have stood by me through every situation—both the joyful and the challenging ones. They have been my constant source of strength, laughter, and encouragement. My friends have always been there for me, no matter what. They have supported me in ways that words can barely describe, defended me when others spoke ill, and brightened even my darkest days with their positivity. I am truly and deeply grateful for having them in my life.

When I look back on the moments that have shaped who I am today, I realize that my friends have played an irreplaceable role in that journey. There have been times when I have felt lost or uncertain about the path ahead, and in those moments, my friends have been like guiding lights. They have always believed in me, even when I doubted myself. Their faith and encouragement have often given me the courage to keep moving forward. Whether it was preparing for an important exam, working on a difficult project, or facing a personal challenge, my friends have always been by my side, offering advice, support, and sometimes simply their comforting presence.

What makes my friends so special is the way they understand me without needing explanations. They can sense when I am upset, even if I try to hide it behind a smile. I remember several times when I was feeling low or frustrated, trying to pretend that everything was fine, and one of them would simply say, “You don’t look okay—do you want to talk about it?” That small question always meant a lot to me. It showed how much they cared and how well they knew me. Sometimes we wouldn’t even need to talk; just sitting together in silence was enough to make me feel better.

Another thing I deeply appreciate about my friends is how they always stand up for me. They never let anyone speak badly about me or treat me unfairly. There were times when misunderstandings arose or when someone tried to put me down, but my friends were always quick to defend me. They didn’t do it out of obligation—they did it because they genuinely valued me and knew my character. Their loyalty has always made me feel safe and respected. In a world where people can sometimes be judgmental or critical, having friends who stand by your side is something truly precious.

My friends also have a unique ability to make me smile, no matter what mood I’m in. Even on days when everything seems to be going wrong, a single joke, a funny story, or even a random meme from one of them can completely change my mood. They have this special way of turning an ordinary moment into something unforgettable. I cherish the times we have laughed until our stomachs hurt, sharing jokes that no one else would understand. Those inside jokes and shared memories have become little treasures that connect us even more deeply.

There is also something magical about the way my friends and I can have fun doing absolutely nothing. We don’t need fancy outings or big plans to enjoy each other’s company. Sometimes, just sitting together, chatting about random things, or listening to music is enough to create moments of pure joy. These simple moments often mean the most because they remind me that happiness doesn’t always come from grand gestures—it comes from being with people who truly make you feel comfortable and loved.

Of course, friendship isn’t only about laughter and fun. True friends are those who stay with you through the difficult times as well. I have seen how my friends have stood by me when life wasn’t easy—when I was stressed, disappointed, or hurt. They never turned away or judged me for my struggles. Instead, they offered me comfort, understanding, and reassurance. Sometimes they didn’t even have to say much; just knowing they were there was enough. That kind of support is rare and precious.

My friends have taught me what unconditional support truly looks like. They have shown me that friendship is about more than sharing good times—it’s about standing together through storms. They have helped me become a stronger, more confident person. Whenever I felt like giving up, they reminded me of my strengths and potential. Whenever I doubted myself, they reminded me of all the things I had accomplished. Their belief in me has been a powerful force that keeps me motivated and optimistic.

Another beautiful thing about my friends is the way they celebrate my successes as if they were their own. When something good happens in my life—no matter how big or small—they are always the first ones to cheer for me. Whether it’s passing an exam, achieving a personal goal, or simply having a good day, they share in my happiness wholeheartedly. Their genuine joy for me reminds me that true friends don’t compete with each other; they lift each other up. That kind of sincerity is something I deeply value and will never take for granted.

I’ve also learned so much from my friends. Each one of them has a different personality, perspective, and way of seeing the world. Being around them has taught me to appreciate diversity in thoughts and experiences. Some of them are calm and thoughtful, while others are energetic and spontaneous. Together, they create a perfect balance in my life. From one friend, I’ve learned the importance of patience; from another, I’ve learned how to stay positive even when things get tough. Every one of them has contributed something meaningful to my growth as a person.

Sometimes, when I think about the future, I wonder where life will take all of us. We may end up in different places, pursuing different dreams, but I know that our bond will remain strong. True friendship doesn’t depend on distance or time—it lives in the heart. Even if we don’t talk every day or see each other often, I know that my friends will always be there for me, just as I will always be there for them. That thought gives me comfort and strength.

Gratitude is the best word to describe how I feel about my friends. They have made my life richer, brighter, and so much more meaningful. Every moment spent with them—whether it’s laughing uncontrollably, having deep conversations, or simply sitting together—adds something beautiful to my memories. They have seen me at my best and my worst, yet they have never stopped caring. Their love and loyalty are things I will cherish forever.

In conclusion, my friends are truly a blessing in my life. They have always supported me, defended me, and made me smile even in the hardest of times. Their friendship has taught me the true meaning of loyalty, kindness, and understanding. I know that without them, my life would not be the same. They have been my constant source of joy, strength, and inspiration. I am forever grateful to have such amazing people by my side—friends who are not just part of my life, but part of who I am.
