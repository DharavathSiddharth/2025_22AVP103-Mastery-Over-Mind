# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
1. To Srinivasan Sir:

Math was, until this semester, really a struggle for me. It was always this difficult subject that I had to study, not one I chose to enjoy. I could easily find motivation for subjects that dealt with telling stories or practical, hands-on creativity, but math felt different. It was that high, rigid wall of complex formulas and rules, which never seemed interesting. Entering into a new semester and having to face college math filled me with that same feeling of dread and resignation.

Everything changed with Srinivasan Sir. From the first class itself in August 2025, everything was completely different. Sir doesn't just teach math; he makes it come alive. He has this unique way of showing that math isn't some rules and regulations but a potent language explaining how the world works. His style of teaching is effective from day one: he takes huge, intimidating concepts, parts of calculus or linear algebra, and breaks those down into small, lucid steps. He always explains why the formula is what it is, rather than just saying how to solve it.

Most importantly, he relates the math on the board to real life. He showed us how these equations are used in finance, in engineering, and even in nature. By sharing stories about the lives and struggles of famous mathematicians, he made the subject feel more human and approachable. This approach didn't just help me understand the material; it made me appreciate the beauty and logic of it.

What really drove my change was Sir's enthusiasm. His love for mathematics is apparent and contagious, and when he teaches, his energy is unstoppable; he treats every single problem as a puzzle, which completely shifted my mindset. I stopped seeing math problems as obstacles and started seeing them as challenges I could solve with patience and logical effort. Thanks to him, I am finally beginning to understand why so many people love mathematics. It provides a clear and reliable structure for understanding everything that surrounds us.

Recently, the mid-terms did not go so well. It was frustrating and discouraging to know that replacing a lifelong habit of disliking a subject takes time. However, the reaction of Sir regarding my poor performance was again a lesson. Not critical at all, he treated my low score as a starting point that was helpful in locating precisely where the help was needed. He gave me specific advice, suggested other ways to study the material, and extended time to catch up on the fundamentals I was missing. The confidence he continuously showed in my ability was quite an inspiration. And though the teacher's continued mentorship has been top-notch, I have the tools and the motivation to become much better for the remainder of the semester. Sir has done much more than teach me mathematics; he taught me how to embrace intellectual difficulty and to find joy in the process.

2. To My SIH Team:

Truly great friends who can balance fun with serious, productive work are definitely a diamond in the rough and often take months, if not longer, to find. I had expected it would take months, or perhaps longer, to find a group that truly clicked. I braced myself for the slow process of getting to know people and navigating different personalities under stress. To my complete surprise and delight, though, the perfect team came together almost instantly.

It all started in the simplest of ways: an out-of-the-blue call in August 2025, asking me to join a team for the Smart India Hackathon. What then seemed like an innocuous choice to participate in a coding competition soon turned into what I believe was a long-standing and important friendship.

It is this rare, perfect balance that makes the SIH team so special. When it is time to work, they are the most focused and committed group imaginable. During the intense hackathon sessions-the all-night coding and deep planning-we operate like true professionals: clear in communication, respecting each other's expertise, and having a mutual goal. Everybody has something different to bring to the table, and we trust each other enough to give brutally honest feedback, which can only push our projects and ourselves to be better. This sharp focus and shared commitment form the professional core of our relationship.

But the magic really happens when the work is done. The minute the laptops close, we shift gears with ease into a team dedicated to having the most fun. Whether it's a spontaneous dinner, watching a movie, or just laughing over silly inside jokes, I always have such an amazing time with them. The energy and dedication we channel into solving complex coding problems are transferred into maximizing our downtime and supporting each other through personal problems. We don’t just tolerate each other outside of work; we look forward to spending time together.

This ability to be both highly accountable and deeply relaxed is something you can't force; it just has to happen. And we clicked immediately. Our bond was forged in the difficulty of the hackathon and strengthened by genuine, unconditional friendship afterward. It’s a relationship built on respecting each other’s intelligence and character equally. I am incredibly thankful for this unexpected gift of a group. They are a constant source of motivation, stress relief, and true friendship. They’ve shown me that you can be highly productive and have a lot of fun at the same time.

3. To the Class Advisors:

At a big college like ours, the opportunity to come across faculty who are easy to talk to and genuinely approachable is a rarity. The relationship between students and faculty often feels formal and far from close. I therefore feel that Section A has been extremely fortunate to have Rohini Ma'am and Sreejith Sir as our class advisors. Arguably the greatest strength they share is their phenomenal approachability. They've managed to make the barriers that exist between students and faculty members almost melt away. They are easy to talk to because they don't just hear you but listen carefully and openly. This gives us the confidence to approach them on everything from small administrative questions to more serious personal or academic concerns. They definitely make it a lot easier to know that their door is always open as we brave college life. What matters most in their advisory service is how they treat our concerns. For every problem mentioned by a student, whether it deals with a heavy workload, disagreement within a group, or just the stress of the semester, Ma'am and Sir never allow us to feel that our problems are sillly or insignificant. They respect every issue. They don't just glance at our worries with simple generic answers; instead, they do active listening to fully understand the situation before giving advice or stepping in to help. That validation is important; it raises our self-esteem within the institution and turns anxiety into a manageable task. They are also very proactive in supporting us. They don't just wait for big problems to happen. They go out of their way to ask for feedback and regularly hold special counseling sessions where we can talk openly and vent our problems without any fear of judgment. These sessions act as a crucial way to release pressure, ensuring that small issues are caught and fixed before they become major crises. They help identify common issues within the class or curriculum, thus enabling quick adjustments. Rohini Ma'am and Sreejith Sir mean much more to us than attendance-checking and paper-pushing administrators. They are kind mentors, genuinely concerned about the well-being of Section A. This combination of organizational skill and human warmth has made our academic environment easier, safer, and friendlier. We really appreciate their commitment, their open approach, and their ability to be approachable faculty members.
