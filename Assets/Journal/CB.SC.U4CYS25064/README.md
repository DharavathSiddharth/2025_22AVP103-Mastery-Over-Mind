Whenever we face problems—whether related to academics, personal matters, or future plans—he always encourages us to speak openly. He listens carefully without judgment and helps us find the best possible solutions. His support makes us feel safe, understood, and confident enough to face any difficulty.

 
2) Date:23rd oct,2025 ,charan : my hostel roommate,he is,helped me teaching subjects for midterm and was a good friend of me.. He is the best one which i got and im lucky to have him as my friend and people like hima re very rare. He has no ego and teaches me how many times till i understand the concept very well. I asked him multiple times, and without any anger or frustration, he explained it to me again and again. What I admire most in him is his patience and willingness to help others. He never makes me feel silly for not understanding something. His help has made me feel more confident in my classes. I am really lucky to have him as my friend and desk partner. He is a very kind person who truly cares about people.Sometimes we stay up late studying for exams, surrounded by open laptops, snacks, and music. Other times, we end up having deep late-night talks about life, dreams, or random funny memories. There are days when the room turns into a study zone, and days when it feels like a comedy club. of course, we fight too — about small things like who didn’t refill the water bottle or who used someone’s shampoo without asking. But no matter what, the fights never last.

 
3) Date:4th nov,2025 ,Ramguru sir : our MAOM class sir,he is kind and because of his ive got my mind plesent which made my mind relief from studies. he is very kind hearted.if any problem arises in his subject we would resolve the problem immediately.his words have inspired me to stay focus and belive in my abilities.HYe is the humble guy and very down to earth. Very rare kind of speciesAnother quality I am deeply grateful for is Sir’s kindness and patience. College life brings many ups and downs, but his calm and understanding nature helps us stay composed and positive through it all. He treats every student with fairness and respect, which builds a strong sense of trust and connection. To me, he is not only an teacher but also a true well-wisher and friend who genuinely wants the best for all of us.
