When I first entered college, I was excited but also a little scared. The idea of leaving home, living in a hostel, and sharing a room with people I barely knew felt strange. I didn’t know what to expect — would we get along? Would we have the same habits? Would I feel at home? But looking back now, I can say with full heart that I got incredibly lucky. My roommates — Nethra, Mansi, and Amirtha — turned out to be much more than just people I share a room with. They became my family away from home, my support system, and my favorite part of college life.From the very first day, all three of them made me feel comfortable. When I walked into the room with my bags and nervous smile, they welcomed me so warmly that my anxiety instantly faded. Instead of feeling like a stranger, I felt like I already belonged. Nethra was the first one to talk — she cracked a light joke about how messy unpacking days always are, and that immediately made me laugh. Mansi offered me some snacks (which, honestly, is the quickest way to my heart), and Amirtha helped me arrange my things neatly. That’s how it started — with laughter, kindness, and a simple act of sharing space.As the days went by, we slowly discovered how different yet perfectly compatible we were. Nethra is the calm one — always organized, always reminding us about deadlines, and somehow managing to stay composed even when everything around us is chaotic. She has this quiet strength that keeps all of us grounded. Whenever I’m stressed or overthinking, Nethra listens patiently and gives the most practical advice. She never judges, never interrupts — she just understands. I truly admire how mature and thoughtful she is. It’s like she has a comforting energy that makes everything feel manageable.Then there’s Mansi, our bundle of joy and chaos rolled into one. She’s the one who keeps our room lively no matter what. Whether it’s her spontaneous dance moves, her funny one-liners, or the way she narrates random stories, she can make anyone smile even on the toughest days. She’s the reason our room never feels dull. When we’re tired after long classes, Mansi always manages to lift our mood with her humor or some crazy idea — like midnight Maggie sessions or impromptu karaoke nights. She may not realize it, but she spreads happiness wherever she goes.And Amirtha — she’s our creative soul. There’s something so refreshing about her personality. She loves to talk about everything — from movies to deep life thoughts — and she brings a sense of excitement to even the simplest things. She’s caring, expressive, and has this amazing way of making us all feel seen and valued. Whenever one of us feels low, Amirtha is the first to notice. She’ll sit next to you, listen, and say exactly what you need to hear. She has this warmth that makes you feel like everything will be okay.Living together has been a beautiful journey of learning and laughter. We’ve developed a rhythm — a mix of chaos and comfort that only roommates can understand. Our room has become more than just a space to sleep; it’s a place filled with shared stories, inside jokes, and memories that will stay with us forever.We help each other through everything — exams, projects, bad days, and homesickness. When one of us falls sick, the others instantly turn into caretakers. When one person’s alarm rings in the morning, somehow all of us wake up (though not always willingly!). When we get ready for class, there’s always a mini fashion discussion — borrowing accessories, asking opinions, and sometimes teasing each other’s choices.The best part of our bond is how natural it feels. We don’t have to try hard to get along. Some nights we sit together talking about life till late, other nights we simply sit in silence doing our own thing but still feeling connected. We celebrate small things — birthdays, good grades, or even surviving a tough week — with so much enthusiasm that our room often feels like a festival.There have also been moments when we’ve comforted each other through tears, stress, or frustration. College life can be overwhelming, but having them around makes even the worst days bearable. If I ever feel down, Nethra’s calmness, Mansi’s laughter, and Amirtha’s comforting words instantly lift my spirit. We remind each other to take breaks, eat properly, and focus on the positives.We’ve also discovered so many fun traditions together — like our Sunday “room cleaning playlist,” where we clean, dance, and sing at the same time, or our late-night gossip sessions that start with one small story and end up lasting hours. Sometimes we even cook together or order food and binge-watch something random just to relax. These little routines have become the highlights of our week.What amazes me most is how we all balance each other out. When one of us is too serious, someone else lightens the mood. When someone’s lazy, the others motivate them to move. It’s a perfect blend of personalities that somehow fits together so well. I’ve realized that the best part of hostel life isn’t the freedom or independence — it’s the friendships that make it all meaningful.Each of them has taught me something valuable. Nethra taught me patience and how to stay calm under pressure. Mansi taught me to enjoy the moment and find happiness in small things. Amirtha taught me the importance of empathy and genuine connection. Together, they’ve made me a better person — more understanding, more joyful, and more confident in facing challenges.Sometimes I think about how different college life would be if I hadn’t met them. It wouldn’t have been this fun, this comforting, or this memorable. They’ve turned ordinary days into beautiful experiences. Every laugh we share, every silly argument, and every late-night talk adds to a collection of memories that I’ll always treasure.In many ways, our friendship feels like a family bond. We look out for each other, fight occasionally, but never stay upset for long. We’ve built a space where we can be our real selves — no pretending, no pressure, just pure comfort.College will eventually end, and we’ll all move to different places, but the memories we’ve created together will stay forever. I know that years from now, when I think of my college days, the first thing that will come to mind won’t be the classrooms or the grades — it’ll be Nethra, Mansi, and Amirtha, and the laughter, support, and love we shared.

When I first joined college, everything felt new, exciting, and a little overwhelming. From managing classes and assignments to adjusting to hostel life and new routines, every day brought something unexpected. I was slowly learning how to handle things on my own — managing time, keeping track of expenses, and figuring out the simplest things, like where to buy daily essentials. It was a big change from home, where everything was taken care of without much effort.One afternoon, something happened that really taught me the value of kindness and quick help. It was a hectic weekday, and I had a long list of things to do. I had just finished a class and was rushing to complete some small but important tasks before my next session. I needed to buy a few essential items — some stationery, printing papers, and a couple of basic things from the campus store. It was one of those days where every minute mattered.When I reached the shop, I realized I had completely run out of cash. I checked my wallet again and again, hoping I had left some money somewhere, but there was nothing. My room was quite far from that area — almost a 15 to 20-minute walk away. Normally, that wouldn’t have been a big issue, but that day, I didn’t have much time to spare. I had a project submission coming up in the next class and needed to get everything ready quickly.I stood there for a few moments, thinking of what to do. Going back to my room would mean wasting precious time, and I might have missed my next class entirely. That’s when I saw one of my senior sisters passing by. She was someone I had met a few times before — always polite and approachable. I hesitated for a moment before asking, but then I decided to just explain the situation honestly.I told her that I had run out of cash and needed to buy a few important items urgently, but going back to my room to get money would take a lot of time. Without any hesitation, she immediately offered to help. She took out some cash and handed it to me with a smile, saying, “Don’t worry about it, just finish your work first.” It was such a simple gesture, but at that moment, it meant a lot to me.I quickly bought what I needed and managed to complete my work on time. Because of her timely help, I didn’t have to run back and forth between the hostel and the store. After finishing everything, I immediately sent the amount to her through PhonePe to return the money. She laughed and said, “You didn’t have to rush it, I knew you’d pay me back.” It was such a small act of kindness on her part, but it saved me from unnecessary stress and allowed me to focus on my tasks.Later that evening, when I had time to relax, I thought about the whole incident. It made me realize how important it is to have good people around — especially in a new place like college. We often underestimate how much small actions can impact someone’s day. For her, it was just a few minutes and a small amount of money, but for me, it was a huge help that day.That moment also taught me something about the spirit of helping others. In college, where everyone is busy with their own schedules, someone taking a moment to help you without expecting anything in return feels genuinely heartwarming. Her kindness inspired me to be the same way toward others. After that day, whenever I saw someone confused or in need — whether it was a junior trying to find a classroom, or someone short of change in the canteen — I remembered how my senior had helped me and tried to offer help in my own small way.This experience also changed the way I viewed relationships in college. It’s easy to think of seniors as strict or distant, but many of them have been through the same struggles and are willing to help if we approach them politely. That senior sister and I still greet each other whenever we cross paths, and she often jokes about how “cash emergencies” are part of the real college experience. It’s funny now, but at that time, it really was a mini-crisis for me.In hindsight, that day was about more than just borrowing money. It was about understanding how support and kindness build connections. It showed me that being independent doesn’t mean doing everything alone — sometimes, it’s about knowing when to ask for help and being grateful for the people who step forward.I learned that gratitude doesn’t always need grand gestures. Sometimes, a simple “thank you” and genuine appreciation mean just as much. I made sure to thank her properly later that day and tell her how much her quick help meant to me. She just smiled and said, “That’s what seniors are for.”Looking back now, I realize how such small moments shape our college life experiences. They teach us humility, gratitude, and the importance of community. The senior who helped me probably doesn’t even remember the incident now, but for me, it remains one of the most meaningful experiences of my early college days. It’s a reminder that even the smallest act of help can make someone’s day easier — and that a little kindness always goes a long way

date : 8th aug'25
The first day of college is something everyone remembers. It’s a mix of excitement, nervousness, and curiosity about what lies ahead. I still remember walking through the campus gates for the very first time — a bag full of essentials, a schedule in my hand, and a head full of questions. The buildings looked huge, the crowd seemed endless, and I had no idea where to go or what to do next.As I stood there trying to figure out my way, a senior noticed that I looked lost and came over with a friendly smile. They simply asked, “Are you new here?” and when I nodded, they said, “Don’t worry, I’ll help you out.” That single moment of kindness turned what could’ve been a confusing day into one I’ll always remember fondly.The senior patiently guided me around the campus, showing me the main areas — classrooms, laboratories, the library, the canteen, and even the notice boards where all the important updates are posted. They shared small but really helpful tips, like where to get printouts quickly, which professors are strict about attendance, and the best times to visit the canteen before it gets crowded. Their guidance made everything feel a lot less intimidating.What impressed me most was their attitude. Despite being busy, they didn’t rush or act like they were doing me a favor. They spoke kindly, answered all my questions, and even checked to make sure I understood the directions properly. It felt like I had known them for a long time, even though we had just met. That friendly and supportive attitude made me feel comfortable and welcome on a campus that, only a few hours earlier, had felt completely new and overwhelming.Later that day, when I struggled to find my next classroom, I called the senior for help. Without hesitation, they guided me again and made sure I reached on time. It might sound like a small gesture, but to someone new and unsure, it meant a lot. Their help saved me from unnecessary confusion and gave me the confidence to move around on my own.Over the next few days, that senior continued to be supportive. Whenever we crossed paths, they would check in and ask how I was settling in. They also helped me understand how things worked at college — from managing time between classes and assignments to participating in extracurricular activities. They even encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone and attend my first college club meeting.What stood out most about this senior was how approachable they were. There was never any sense of hierarchy or superiority; instead, they treated me like a younger friend. They often shared their own first-day experience and how someone had once helped them too, saying, “Everyone needs a little guidance when they’re new.” That sentence stayed with me. It showed how kindness can create a chain of good deeds — someone helps you, and one day, you help someone else.Their support made a huge difference in my early college experience. Whenever I was unsure about a process, an event, or even just college life in general, I knew I could turn to them for clear and honest advice. They never made me feel like I was asking a silly question. In fact, they encouraged me to ask more, saying that learning starts with curiosity.As weeks went by, I began feeling more confident and independent. I started exploring new places on campus, making friends, and even helping other new students when I could. But deep down, I always remembered that my smooth transition into college life was possible because of that one senior’s patience and kindness.Looking back now, I realize how a small act of help can make such a big difference. That senior probably didn’t think much of it — to them, it was just another day helping a junior — but for me, it completely shaped my impression of college life. Instead of fear and confusion, I felt welcomed and supported.That experience taught me something important: college isn’t just about classes and exams; it’s also about people — the ones who guide you, support you, and make your journey meaningful. I’ve promised myself that when I become a senior, I’ll do the same. I’ll help newcomers find their way, share tips, and make them feel comfortable, just the way someone once did for me.Even now, whenever I see that senior around campus, I feel grateful. Their small gestures of kindness left a lasting impact on me. They showed me that sometimes, being kind and taking a few minutes to help someone can completely change how they see the world around them.
