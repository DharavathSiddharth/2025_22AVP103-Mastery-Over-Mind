scenario:Before the mid-term exams I was weak in maths subject.
Gratitude To:My roommate sandilya.
Before 1 week of the midterm exams,my friend taught me the maths subject from basics.since I was weak in the subject.Maths bothered me a lot before our midterm examinations. No matter how many times I read the formulas or watched tutorials, I couldn’t understand the concepts. Since maths was one of the toughest subjects for me, with midterms just a week away, I had already started feeling the low. And that is when my roommate Sandilya noticed my stress and decided to help me. he would explain each topic from the basics. I’m really thankful that I have a roommate like Sandilya, one who helped me make my weakness a strength and taught me that learning is easy when someone believes in you.

3)Date:25.10.2025
scenario:After the midterm exams i was felling low by my performence in mid-term exams.
Gratitude To:My cousion Jithendra.
After the midterm exams, I was feeling really low. Even with all the effort and help from my friends, my marks didn’t turn out the way I was expecting. I felt disappointed; perhaps I wasn’t good enough to study engineering. I started comparing myself to others, which made it worse. I didn’t talk much to anyone and just kept quiet most of the time. It was then that my cousin Jithendra came to my rescue.He is in the same college, and that is why he felt something wrong with me. One evening he called me to the canteen and said, "What's wrong with you? You look lost." At first, I didn't want to tell him anything, but then everything came out — how I was feeling a failure, how afraid I was of disappointing everybody, and how I felt I wasn't improving even after trying. He heard me up quietly and didn't interrupt me at all. Then he smiled and said something which I'll never forget: "Marks don't decide your future, your mindset does."He started sharing his story — how in his first year he, too, failed one subject and thought he wasn’t capable. But he didn’t give up. He told me that failure is just a part of learning and that one bad result doesn’t mean you are not intelligent. His words gave me a kind of peace I hadn’t felt for days. And he helped me plan how to do better next time — how to make short notes, revise regularly, and not panic before exams.
What touched me most was his belief in me. He said, “I know you can do it. You just need to trust yourself.” That one line changed my attitude completely. From that day onward, I stopped feeling sorry for myself and started working again, slowly but steadily. Instead of fearing it, I began to enjoy studying again.That conversation with Jithendra turned out to be a turning point in my life. He didn’t just give me motivation; he gave me perspective. He made me realize that mistakes and failures are not signs of weakness — they are steps toward growth. Now whenever I feel down, I remember his words and get back up. I'm deeply grateful to my cousin Jithendra for being my guide and emotional support. He didn't just lift me up during a low phase; he taught me how to lift myself up. His kindness, his patience, and his belief in me are things I'll carry throughout my life. I can never forget the moment when his advice turned my sadness into strength.
