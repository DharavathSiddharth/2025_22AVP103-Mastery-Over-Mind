## Journal Record
I am profoundly grateful to Sreenivasan sir, my maths teacher here, whose dedication and passion have deeply inspired me. I have never seen a person who puts in his whole and soul just to make us understand complex mathematical concepts. His teaching approach creates such a strong connection with students, including me, that no matter what happens outside the classroom, we feel assured and welcomed whenever he enters with his warm smile.
What makes Sreenivasan sir truly exceptional is his ability to transform maths lessons into entertaining and engaging experiences. He uses exciting methods and creative ways to explain even the toughest topics, ensuring that everyone enjoys learning and actively participates. This has made a significant difference in my learning journey as I look forward to every class with enthusiasm.
One of the most remarkable qualities of sir is his deep understanding of student mentality. He patiently grants us enough time often like 10 second pauses to absorb and process the material, allowing us to catch up and respond comfortably. This thoughtful pacing builds confidence and motivation among students, making learning less intimidating and more achievable.
My very first interaction with sir was during orientation when my parents spoke with him. From that moment, I felt a sense of warmth and happiness as he remembered me, smiled, and greeted me whenever we met. This simple gesture of acknowledgment has made me feel valued and cared for throughout my time here.
There was a day when I was experiencing a severe headache during his class and had to lie down. Sir noticed and came over gently to ask what was wrong. He thoughtfully offered to turn off the fan above my seat to make me more comfortable. His genuine concern in that moment made me feel truly happy and gifted—like I had a guardian looking out for me.
Sreenivasan sir's commitment, empathy, and innovative teaching style have not only helped me improve in maths but also contributed to my overall confidence and happiness as a student. I am sincerely thankful to him for being such an inspiring teacher and a caring human being.
His consistent encouragement, understanding nature, and the unique bond he creates with his students make him unforgettable in my academic journey. I hope to carry forward the lessons he has instilled in me both inside and outside the classroom.
In conclusion, Sreenivasan sir is much more than a teacher; he is a mentor, a guide, and a friend who genuinely cares about our growth. His efforts and kindness have touched my heart deeply, and I will always be grateful for everything he has done for me and continues to do.

I want to express my deepest gratitude to Chithra Mam, our hostel warden, whose kindness and motherly care have been a pillar of strength to me. Being someone who is incredibly attached to my mother, coming to the hostel brought an overwhelming wave of homesickness that I struggled with. Adding to the challenge, I have specific health requirements clean restrooms are essential for me to stay healthy. However, Chithra Mam has been my unwavering support through these difficult times.
One specific Sunday in August 2025, I was feeling exceptionally down and visibly sad. To my surprise and relief, Chithra Mam noticed my distress and approached me with such warmth and sweetness. She reassured me with kind words, telling me that it would be alright and that I would soon enjoy life in the hostel. She told me she would always be there for me, which gave me a comfort akin to a mother's embrace.
Her attentiveness went beyond words. When the restrooms were once in a poor state of cleanliness something that I, due to my health concerns, dread she listened with patience and immediately took action, instructing the helper to clean them thoroughly. Such prompt care made me feel safe and cared for.
Moreover, she is one of the few people in the hostel who make a genuine effort to check on me regularly asking if I am fine, if I have eaten, and always greeting me with a warm smile and a wave. She even helps me with all the passes and administrative support, making my life much easier here.
In many ways, Chithra Mam gives me a motherly feeling in this hostel far from home. Her compassion has been a beacon of light for me, and I am eternally thankful for her presence in my life.

I am deeply grateful to my dear friend Bhavana, whose kindness and sincerity have touched my heart in ways words can hardly express. When I first arrived here, my heart was overwhelmed with homesickness and a sense of loneliness, especially since I was placed in a different section where I knew no one. I felt like I was carrying a heavy burden on my shoulders, yearning for the comfort of my home and the warmth of my family. Amidst this vulnerability, Bhavana appeared as a ray of hope and light. She was the first person I felt I could approach without hesitation—the moment I gathered courage and asked if I could sit beside her, she welcomed me with an open and genuine smile, instantly soothing my fears and giving me a sense of belonging I had been desperately seeking.
The journey of our friendship blossomed quickly. Bhavana not only welcomed me into her circle but also showed deep compassion when she understood the pain of my homesickness. She listened patiently and never once judged me. When I felt overwhelmed by my emotions, especially during those initial days, she stood silently by my side, offering comfort and support just through her presence. Her unwavering friendship became my anchor in this unfamiliar environment.
One particularly emotional day was on August 12th, my birthday. That day, I felt an intense wave of loneliness and sadness; I had no family nearby, and the ache of missing my loved ones was almost unbearable. I couldn’t hold back my tears and had to cry alone, feeling isolated despite being surrounded by others. Bhavana saw my distress and gently approached me. Standing by my side, she didn’t try to fix everything or offer superficial comfort. Instead, her calming presence and sincere words made me feel seen and understood. She told me, "You are not alone, and soon you will find happiness here." Her words, coupled with the warmth of her smile, made a profound difference. She gave me a sense of friendship that was pure and genuine, helping me feel loved and accepted despite my emotional struggles.
Over time, our friendship grew stronger. We started as simple benchmates, sharing space, but now she is someone I trust completely—someone I can confide in about anything without fear of judgment. She is also always mindful of my emotional sensitivity. She often encourages me to eat when I resist, knowing how important good nutrition is for my health and mental well-being. She pays for my food sometimes, doing those small acts with such sincerity that I feel overwhelmed with gratitude. Her kindness makes me feel as though I have a small family here, in a place far from home.
One event that touched me deeply was when I missed my lunch due to an important committee meeting. I had been so caught up in my responsibilities that I completely forgot to eat. Bhavana noticed my absence and immediately came to me. Without saying much, she took me to the canteen and sat with me. She didn’t do anything extraordinary—she simply sat beside me, engaging in quiet companionship, ensuring I ate even if I wasn’t hungry. She patiently waited while I ate slowly, humming softly, making the process feel warm and comforting. That moment made me realize how truly thoughtful and selfless she is—her actions reflected a genuine concern for my well-being that went beyond superficial gestures. It touched my heart deeply, showing me the real meaning of friendship: being there for someone in both good and bad times, with sincerity and love.Bhavana always makes little efforts that I cherish immensely—waiting for me after classes, checking if I am okay, and encouraging me to stay positive despite the challenges. These seemingly small acts have become immense sources of comfort for me.
