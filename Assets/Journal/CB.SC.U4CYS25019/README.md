To  kind the girl

something simple yet deeply meaningful happened — an act of kindness that reminded me how beautiful it is when strangers choose compassion over convenience. It happened in the washing area, a place that usually feels mundane and routine, but today, it became a place where I experienced genuine kindness.I had been standing for quite some time, waiting for a washing stone to become free. The washing area was crowded, and everyone seemed busy with their own chores. I didn’t want to disturb anyone or ask directly, so I just waited quietly, hoping someone would finish soon. Minutes passed, and my patience started to fade. I was tired, and honestly, a bit hesitant — I kept thinking, “Should I ask someone?” But something in me held back, perhaps shyness or just the thought that it wasn’t worth troubling others.And then, just as I was about to give up, a kind girl noticed me. She was washing her clothes nearby, and without hesitation, she called out to me. She told me there was an empty washing stone near her, one that I hadn’t noticed. Her voice was calm, warm, and sincere — it carried a tone of care that immediately comforted me. I felt such relief wash over me; her small gesture made such a big difference in that moment.But what touched me even more was what happened next. Just as I started walking toward that spot, another girl arrived at the same time and was about to use the same stone. I felt awkward and unsure about what to do — after all, she had just come, and I didn’t want to cause any conflict. Before I could say anything, the kind girl spoke up again. She told the other girl gently that I had been waiting for a long time, that I was standing there patiently, and that I deserved the turn. Her words were thoughtful and fair. She didn’t say them loudly or harshly, but in a calm and considerate way that made everyone comfortable. The other girl nodded and understood, and I was able to use the stone without any issue. I can’t express how thankful I felt in that moment. It wasn’t just about getting a washing stone — it was about being seen. When you’re struggling quietly, it means so much when someone notices and steps in to help. Her kindness didn’t just make my task easier; it lifted my entire mood. I smiled the whole time I was washing, thinking about how her simple action reflected such empathy and understanding.Afterward, I made sure to thank her sincerely. She just smiled and said, “It’s okay,” as if it was the most natural thing to do. That’s what made it even more special — she didn’t do it for attention or gratitude, she did it simply because she cared.

To Anushree and Ridhanya

Today, as I reflect on my journey in college and hostel life, my heart fills with gratitude for Anushree and Ridhanya. They are more than just classmates — they have been  my greatest support, and the reason I never truly felt alone even when I missed home.When I first joined college, I struggled a lot with homesickness. I missed my family, my home-cooked food, and the comfort of my routine. Being in the hostel was a completely new experience — new faces, new environment, and new responsibilities. During those early days, I often skipped meals or ate very little because I couldn’t adjust to the hostel food. That’s when my friends stepped in. They noticed my struggle without me even having to explain it. most of the day, they would bring me home food — simple, warm, and full of love. Sometimes it was  rice, sometimes a snack, or even something sweet their parents had prepared. It wasn’t just the food that comforted me; it was their thoughtfulness and the feeling that someone cared for me when I was away from home. Slowly, their kindness helped me overcome my homesickness and adjust to hostel life with a smile.Apart from this, they helped me in my studies too. Coming from a biology background, I didn’t have much experience with programming languages like Python. At first, I was nervous and even embarrassed to ask for help. But my friends never made me feel less. They patiently taught me everything from the basics — explaining each concept again and again until I understood. Not once did they show irritation or hesitation. Instead, they encouraged me, saying, “You can learn this easily, we’ll help you.” Their support gave me confidence in a subject I once feared.There are so many small things they’ve done for me that I’ll never forget. Like today, after college, they came with me all the way to the hostel by walking, even though they had a shuttle from our block to the bus stand. Their bags were heavy, and they were tired, but they still chose to walk beside me just because they didn’t want me to go alone. That moment touched me deeply. It made me realize how pure and selfless true friendship can be — they put my comfort before their own convenience.I also remember another day clearly. I had to go home by the college bus, but I didn’t know which one to take. I was confused and a bit panicked, standing there with my luggage. Again, my friends came to the rescue. They not only helped me find the correct bus but also carried my luggage all the way to it. They waited until I got a seat and made sure I was comfortable. Even after the bus left, they texted me to check whether I reached home safely. Their care and concern made me feel so loved and protected, just like how my family would.When I think about these moments, I realize how lucky I am. Not everyone finds such genuine friends — friends who treat you like family, who share their time, food, and energy just to make your life easier. Their kindness has taught me that true friendship isn’t about how long you’ve known someone but about how much they stand by you when you need them the most.I feel deeply grateful for them — for their patience when teaching me, for their care when I was homesick, and for their company when I felt lonely. They have filled my college life with laughter, comfort, and unforgettable memories. I hope someday I can return even a fraction of the love and kindness they’ve given me.
