# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
7th August 2025 - SCENERIO 1

My initial decision to attend this college was a mix of excitement and deep-seated apprehension. Growing up in another state steeped in its own particular linguistic and culinary tradition, I could feel in detail both the geographical distance and cultural chasm I was about to cross. The first days confirmed my expectations: the air was thick with a symphony of languages-a quick, rhythmic cadence distinctly different from my mother tongue. The cafeteria presented a vibrant, sometimes bewildering, array of regional dishes, and the unspoken social rules felt momentarily opaque. One single, persistent fear dominated my inner voice: "This is going to be incredibly difficult because of the different state, language, and food; will I truly belong here?"
The fear was a strong, almost tangible barrier. I had steeled myself for a period of deep loneliness and dislocation, in which the weight of cultural difference seemed likely to cut me off. I was prepared to experience subtle exclusion or to find that even something as trivial as the search for a dialect that sounded like my own or a favorite comfort food became a challenge. This perhaps was the biggest emotional obstacle for me: the inner conviction that when something is different, it automatically means farther away.
What happened was a remarkable and profoundly comforting surprise: instead of difficulty, I found immediate and widespread acceptance. Within days, the strangeness began to wear off. I got used to the new routines, the varied spices of the food, and the melodic variety of the campus languages. But the turning point was when I realized that my colleagues and peers didn't treat me differently. No segregation, no awkward pause as one speaks with another accent, and certainly no feeling of being an outsider.
I can say with utter conviction: this is the best thing to this date. It wasn't the infrastructure or the academic program that defined my early success here, but the sheer warmth and open-mindedness of the community. It provided a feeling of belonging that melted away my geographical anxieties. I realized the differences that I had fixated on, language and food, were not walls but just interesting facts about a person, much like their favorite movie or their major. The base for human connection here is not homogeneity; rather, it's mutual respect and curiosity.
The positive reception fueled a profound shift in my perspective. Instead of seeing the multitude of languages as a barrier, I now view them as an immense, open field to explore. I have made so many friends, and what is truly enriching is the fact that they are all very helpful in my quest to understand their worlds. They don't make fun of my pronunciation or confusion; instead, they calmly teach me basic phrases, explain regional idioms, and share the cultural context behind their words.
I catch myself making conscious efforts to explore so many languages. It is a rather difficult but rewarding exercise. A simple greeting in a friend's mother tongue brings forth an infectious smile and suddenly cements the bond. It's an act of respect-a way of showing that their heritage is important to me. This exploratory journey has taught me one important thing: language is not just a means to communicate; it is a vessel of history, emotion, and identity. And each and every one of my friends is turning out to be a very patient and enthusiastic teacher in this lesson that keeps ongoing.
It was that day , and today where i make so many friends-Sathwika,Deepthi my very good friends, my rooates-Nethra ,Amirtha, and Harshitha ,Advik , Sreekantha-always ready to help me with technial issues, Aadi and midhun-cute and like little brothers .For Midhun I am his didi and for me he is my aniyan

The transition would have been far more arduous without the immediate comfort of my living situation. After coming here, I was lucky to get very good roommates-Nethra,Amirtha,and Harshitha who are characterized by their remarkable kindness and helpfulness. Nethra is the one who brings life to our room . Harshitha and e have the same music taste. Amirtha , she is so kind always ready to help. Because of them, my days have become very good with their consistent and cheerful presence. I actually enjoy their company immensely, and our shared space is characterized by laughter, support, and an effortless rhythm that defies our diverse backgrounds.
In our room, four different languages are a reflection of four different identities. One might think that this would give rise to communication problems or possibly even cultural conflicts over the choice of music or the TV channel, but this is not the case at all. We've developed a shared, hybrid means of communication, basically a combination of English, basic elements from each other's language, and especially non-verbal means and intuition. And this linguistic variety doesn't impede our unity; it is what gives depth and value to our friendship. Language differences notwithstanding, they are never absent when I need to discuss anything, from the campus registration system to a midnight snack. They embody the principle that empathy transcends vocabulary.

The most recent, and perhaps most telling, manifestation of this supportive campus culture came when I was facing my version of a technological meltdown. Stuck with a serious problem in my laptop that jeopardized an important assignment, I went in search of help, panicking. The person whom I approached was one with whom I had interacted previously in passing, transactional conversations only,Sreekanth. The exchange that ensued turned out to be one of genuine, selfless altruism. He didn't just provide a quick fix or refer me to a service center. He became fully invested in my problem. He helped me till the time I was stuck in that, meticulously troubleshooting, researching solutions, and patiently explaining the technical jargon. His commitment was total. Now, we are good friends. The crisis forged a deep, appreciative bond. Surprisingly, he is younger than me, but sometimes behaves like an older brother. He gives sensible advice about college life without being asked to, asks about my progress from time to time, and has a maturity that belies his age. This unexpected connection-a result of a technical glitch-has given me one of the most heartwarming relationships here. So, I can say that it was also a good day because in a friend, I found a little brother.
