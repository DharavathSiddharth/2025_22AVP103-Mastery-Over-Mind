# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record

# MATHS SIR

On October 23, 2025, I had an experience in my Mathematics class that really stuck with me. It was one of those mornings when the campus felt 
fresh after a light rain, and the hallways buzzed with students rushing to their first classes. I remember stepping into Mr. Srinivasan’s room, 
my notebook already flipped open to the chapter on matrix reduction. He was at the board, chalk in hand, breaking down how to simplify a system 
of equations into echelon form. His handwriting was impressively neat, with every number perfectly aligned and each explanation flowing 
seamlessly from one line to the next. What always struck me about his teaching was the energy he brought not loud or over-the-top, but steady, 
confident, and filled with a genuine enthusiasm for the subject.

That day, though, I found myself stuck on something that felt embarrassingly simple. He had just shown us a row operation, swapping two rows to 
simplify a matrix, and I couldn’t wrap my head around why that was even allowed. It seemed so arbitrary. As he continued explaining, my mind 
kept circling back to that step, and I started to overthink it. I glanced around my classmates were all busy taking notes, some even nodding as 
if everything made perfect sense. I felt a bit foolish for not getting it. For a few minutes, I wrestled with whether to ask a question or not. 
I was worried that if I spoke up, people might laugh or think I wasn’t paying attention.

But then, I remembered how approachable Mr. Srinivasan always was. His classroom never felt like a place where questions were frowned upon. So, 
I raised my hand, a bit hesitantly, and asked, “Sir, could you please explain again why we can interchange the rows like that?”

He turned to me calm, composed, completely unfazed and said, “Good question.” There was no sarcasm in his voice, no hint that he thought it was 
silly. He walked back to the board, wiped away the last few lines, and started the explanation anew. “When we perform row operations, we’re 
simply rearranging the equations,” he said. “The relationships between the equations remain intact, allowing us to solve the system more easily. 
Then he demonstrated it with a smaller example, speaking slowly, carefully, making sure I was following every step. Something about his demeanor 
really resonated with me. He didn’t dismiss my doubts as insignificant; instead, he acknowledged them as valid. That one gesture transformed my 
approach to learning. From that moment on, I started asking more questions without the fear of being judged. I even noticed an improvement in my 
internal exam scores because my understanding deepened. His calm confidence instilled a sense of assurance in me not just in math, but in how I 
tackled problems overall. I came to realize that curiosity shouldn’t be stifled; it should be nurtured. Mr. Srinivasan’s teaching style, his 
patience, and his unwavering composure made math not only easier but also enjoyable.

# Mr. Amit Sir

The next moment that filled me with gratitude occurred on August 30, 2025, during my Principles of Engineering class with Mr. Amit Agarwal. That 
morning had kicked off on a frustrating note. My college bus was stuck in heavy traffic, and by the time I finally arrived on campus, the class 
had already begun. I remember glancing at my watch anxiously  it was around 9:10 a.m., twenty minutes into an 8:50 class. My heart sank as I 
climbed the stairs to the lecture hall. With about 120 students in that class, walking in late meant all eyes would be on me.

As I opened the door, that’s precisely what happened. The room was enveloped in a focused silence, the kind that settles when the teacher is 
discussing something crucial. The atmosphere felt thick with concentration. I could sense all those gazes on me, the soft scraping of chairs, a 
few hushed whispers. Mr. Amit glanced up from his notes. For a brief moment, I braced myself for the usual perhaps a comment about being late or 
a reminder about attendance. Instead, he simply said, “Come in. Sit quietly and catch up with what we’re doing.” His tone was neither annoyed 
nor harsh; it was firm yet kind.

I quickly found a seat at the back, still feeling a bit embarrassed, but that small act of understanding shifted my entire mood. He didn’t shame 
me or make an example of me in front of my peers. He just gave me the opportunity to keep learning. That moment stuck with me long after class 
was over. It wasn’t anything dramatic, but it had a subtle yet powerful impact. I realized just how much a teacher’s attitude can shape a 
student’s mindset. If he had scolded me, I would have lost my focus for the rest of the day. But because he chose to show empathy instead of 
authority, I found myself respecting him even more. It also made me more aware of being on time not out of fear, but out of respect for the 
trust he placed in us.


Mr. Amit Agarwal’s classes are special in that regard. He gives every student the space to breathe. There’s no unnecessary pressure or tension; 
it’s an environment that encourages you to think and engage. He often brings in real-life examples to clarify abstract concepts, and his 
explanations are always adaptable, never rushed. That day on August 30 made me realize how much kindness can thrive even within structure. He 
showed me that discipline doesn’t have to be harsh; it can go hand in hand with understanding.

# Canteen ANNA

Then, on November 1, 2025, something as simple as a gesture of hospitality reminded me of the quiet humanity that keeps our college running 
smoothly. It was during lunch break, around 1:05 p.m., right in the middle of the afternoon rush. The canteen was packed long lines at the 
counter, students balancing plates, and the sounds of clattering steel tumblers mixed with lively chatter. My friends and I had just wrapped up 
our morning classes, and we were starving. We hesitated at the entrance because there wasn’t a single table available. It felt like one of those 
chaotic festival fairs where everyone’s voices blend together, and the aroma of food fills the air.

That’s when Mr. Boopathy, one of the canteen’s housekeeping staff, spotted us. He’s someone we see almost every day always busy cleaning tables, 
arranging chairs, and somehow still managing to smile at everyone. When our eyes met, I smiled out of habit, and he immediately motioned for us 
to hang on for a moment. Within minutes, he cleared a corner table, wiped it down, and made it ready for us. It was a small gesture, but in that 
moment, it felt like a massive relief. We were exhausted, hungry, and the crowd was just overwhelming, but he stepped up to ensure we were 
comfortable. We expressed our gratitude before settling down, and he simply smiled and said, “Sabka din achha ho,” before returning to his tasks.

From that day on, I made it a point to greet him every morning. Sometimes he’d reply with a cheerful “Good morning, beta,” or check in to see if 
the food was alright. Those brief exchanges became a comforting part of my daily routine. What really stood out to me about him was his 
unwavering kindness no matter how hectic or chaotic things got, he always maintained that same warm demeanor. He didn’t have to go out of his 
way for anyone, yet he did it effortlessly, without expecting anything in return.

That day, November 1, reminded me that gratitude isn’t just for teachers or mentors; it’s for everyone who enriches our lives in their own 
unique way. The kindness of people like Mr. Boopathy often goes unnoticed, yet they are the ones who help our days run smoothly. Observing how 
he carried himself always respectful, always smiling encouraged me to be more aware and appreciative of those who make those small, often 
invisible contributions around us.
