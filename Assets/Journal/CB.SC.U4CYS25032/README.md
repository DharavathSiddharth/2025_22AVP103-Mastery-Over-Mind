## Journal Record
My gratitude Journal is about the persons who have thought me new things and made myself to move on a right track. They are

1.Gratitude towards teacher:
Basically I don't known about computers but, the teachers in amrita taught me in clear manner which helps me to improve knowledge and score more marks in exam
A teacher is much more than just an instructor; they are guides, mentors, and inspirations. Their dedication and hard work often go unnoticed, yet their influence lasts a lifetime. I am deeply grateful to all teachers who have devoted themselves to educating and nurturing students.

From the moment a child steps into a classroom, a teacher’s responsibility extends beyond teaching academic subjects. They teach us values such as honesty, kindness, and perseverance through their own example. Their patience and understanding help students overcome challenges and build confidence. Every lesson they prepare demonstrates their commitment to our growth.

Teachers inspire curiosity and encourage us to ask questions. They open our minds to new ideas and broaden our horizons, helping us develop critical thinking skills. Thanks to their guidance, we not only gain knowledge but also learn how to apply it in real life. A good teacher sparks a love for learning that never fades.

2.Gratitude towards friends:
when I came to amrita I felt lonely but,my friends gave me joy and helped me in academics and also in  preparation for exam.
Friendship is one of life’s greatest gifts, a treasure that enriches our souls and strengthens our journey. Feeling gratitude towards friends is recognizing that their presence adds profound meaning and happiness to our lives. Friends are our chosen family; they stand by us through thick and thin, offering support, encouragement, and love without conditions.

Friends listen when we need to talk, celebrate our successes, and comfort us during setbacks. They provide different perspectives that help us grow and inspire us to become better versions of ourselves. For these reasons, expressing gratitude to friends is essential—it honors the unique bond that connects us and affirms the value of their role in our lives.



3.Gratitude towards wardens:
warden in amrita university is not rude and harss like other colleges they were very kind and helpful to us.
Hostel wardens hold a special place in the lives of students who reside in hostels. They are more than just supervisors; they are guardians, mentors, and pillars of support who work tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure the well-being, safety, and comfort of all residents. It is important to acknowledge and express sincere gratitude for the immense contributions they make throughout the academic year.

Firstly, hostel wardens maintain discipline and order in the hostel environment which is vital for creating a peaceful living and studying space. Managing a large group of students, often from diverse backgrounds, requires patience, understanding, and strong leadership skills. Wardens set the ground rules, resolve conflicts amicably, and ensure that everyone respects the community’s norms. Their fair and firm approach ensures that every student gets an equal opportunity to live harmoniously and focus on their studies.

Secondly, their role in ensuring safety cannot be overstated. Wardens often remain alert to any emergencies, health concerns, or security issues. They act promptly in situations that demand immediate attention, helping students feel secure far from home. Many wardens take a personal interest in the safety of the students, organizing regular checks, fire drills, and counseling sessions when needed. Their constant vigilance reassures parents and students alike that the hostel is a safe haven.
