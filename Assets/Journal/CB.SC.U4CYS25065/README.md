# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind



## Journal Record

I am grateful for many peoples, here i will share 3 of them. 
First scenario: Aug 7th 2024: First when i came to this campus i was very tensed about everything, my parents was also very tensed, I wondered whether I would be able to manage the academics, whether I would find a good group of friends, and whether I could actually adjust to hostel life. My parents shared these concerns as well. They were equally tense, perhaps even more than I was, because I was leaving home for the first time. On the very first day, when I entered the hostel room, all these thoughts were still running through my mind. I did not know what kind of person I would meet, what kind of environment I would have to adjust to, or how long it would take for me to feel comfortable. Then I met Aadidevan. He introduced himself, and soon I realized he too was from Kerala. He was also little bit tensed like me, after we saw each other we both felt some relief in mind, We talked about our hometowns, our schooling, our families, and even about our fears regarding this new journey. Neither of us tried to hide how we felt. That honesty made our bond natural and effortless. The conversation we had that day made both of us feel lighter, from there till now he is a very good friend to me, he will help me in studies, always will give company everywhere Even though we were in different sections academically, being roommates allowed us to accompany each other in almost everything else. Whether it was going to the mess, exploring the campus, attending events, or simply sitting in the room studying, we supported each other. If I ever struggled with a topic or felt stressed before an exam, he would sit with me and help me understand things calmly.And when he needed help, I was always ready to do the same for him.

Second Scenario: April: The next person is from amrita central library his name was Ranjith, he also helped me and my parents when we was here for the first time, like he was the one who told the admission procedures for this college, He explained the admission procedure step by step: writing the entrance exam, preparing well for board exams, scoring well if possible in JEE, and how all these components contribute to admission etc.. he also motivated me to study hard. For my parents, seeing someone speak kindly, patiently, and positively made a huge difference. He encouraged me to believe in myself. His guidance helped remove the confusion we had and turned it into clarity and confidence. Without his guidance at the beginning, I might not have taken the right steps in preparing myself. His words shaped my mindset before I even entered the campus.

Third Scenario: August-November: Third one is our Ramaguru sir, who was our MAOM teacher and my hackathon mentor, When we decided to participate in a hackathon, he became our mentor. Hackathons require creativity, teamwork, and proper guidance, and even though he was busy with many responsibilities, he still took time to help us. He ensured we understood how to structure our project. e guided us step by step, always patient and encouraging. With his support, we were able to perform well and even win the internal hackathon and also his classes are very good because it will be very interactive we can easily connect to whatever he says. His mentorship did not just help me academically, it inspired me. It made me realize the importance of learning deeply, working consistently, and believing in one's own abilities. So these are the three people who i am grateful for.
