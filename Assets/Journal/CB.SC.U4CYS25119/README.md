Senario : First Day in Hostel

My first day in the hostel will always remain a beautiful memory that I hold close to my heart. It was the 9th of August, 2007 — a day filled with nervousness, excitement, and uncertainty. After spending six months at home, I was finally stepping into hostel life, something I had never experienced before. Until that day, I had always been surrounded by family, my parents’ care, and the comfort of home. The thought of living away from them, in a new place with new people, made me anxious. I kept wondering how I would adjust, whether I would be able to make friends, and if I would feel lonely.
But destiny had planned something wonderful for me. That very first day, I met a group of amazing people — my friends Gagana, Keerthi, Niharika, Harshini and Sruthi. From the very first conversation, something about them made me feel relaxed. They had this warmth and friendliness that immediately eased my tension. I remember entering the hostel room, my hands shaking slightly, my heart beating fast, and then hearing their cheerful voices welcoming me. They smiled genuinely and helped me settle in.
That evening, after unpacking my luggage, I sat with them in the corridor. They started sharing funny stories about what happened in class, about hostel food, and the silly mistakes they made during the first few days. Soon, laughter filled the air. I found myself laughing freely, forgetting all my earlier fears. We talked about our favorite subjects, movies, songs, and hobbies. That night was supposed to be difficult — my first night away from home — but instead, it became one of the happiest nights of my life.
What made that moment special was how naturally they made me feel included. They didn’t treat me like a newcomer. They talked to me as if we had known each other for years. Gagana made jokes nonstop, Harshini sang softly while we all listened, and Keerthi teased her about her singing. Niharika and Sruthi shared snacks they had brought from home, and we all sat in a circle sharing food, laughter, and stories. I realized then that friendship can create a sense of family even when you’re far from home.
Before coming to the hostel, I had been scared about managing everything by myself — waking up early, attending classes, handling my belongings, and sleeping alone. But that first night, as we all talked until late, I realized I wasn’t alone anymore. These people would be my new support system. Their kindness and fun-loving nature took away all my fear.
That bond has stayed strong even after all these years. Whenever I look back, I realize how one day changed so much in my life. Those first few hours shaped my entire hostel experience. They taught me the value of friendship and how small gestures of warmth can completely transform someone’s day. I’m deeply thankful to my friends for giving me such a wonderful start, for treating me with so much care, and for continuing to stand by me even now.
Hostel life has taught me many lessons, but the most important one is this — people make a place feel like home. And for me, that home feeling came from these beautiful souls. I’ll always be grateful to Gagana, Keerthi, Niharika, Harshini, and Sruthi for making my first day so memorable and turning my fear into happiness.

Senario : Friday Afternoon — Help from a Friend
It was a Friday afternoon, and we had only one class scheduled that day. The weather was warm and a bit exhausting, and I was already feeling tired. During the lunch break, I decided to take my bag back to the hostel because it was heavy and I didn’t want to carry it around the entire day. But time was running out quickly — lunch break was almost over, and I realized I wouldn’t make it back in time if I went to the hostel and returned for class.
At that moment, my friend Valli noticed the worried look on my face. She asked me what happened, and I explained how I wanted to drop my bag at the hostel but didn’t have enough time. I was also feeling guilty about leaving my things behind because some of my notes and assignments were inside that bag. Without thinking twice, she immediately said, “Don’t worry, I’ll take it for you.” I was surprised because I knew she wasn’t feeling well that day — she had complained about body pains earlier. I told her it’s okay, I’d manage somehow, but she insisted.
She picked up my bag and carried it all the way to the hostel. The sun was strong, and it wasn’t an easy walk, but she didn’t complain even once. She safely kept my bag in my room and returned, a bit tired but smiling. I felt genuinely moved by her kindness. Small acts like these may seem ordinary to others, but for me, it meant a lot. In that moment, I understood the true meaning of friendship — it’s not just about spending fun time together, but about being there for each other when needed.Later that day, I thanked her sincerely. She simply said, “It’s okay, you’d do the same for me,” and smiled. That response made me realize how selfless some people can be. I was so touched because she put my comfort before her own, even when she wasn’t feeling well.This incident reminded me that gratitude isn’t always about big gestures — sometimes, it’s about small, thoughtful actions that make life easier.
That one moment taught me to be more observant and more thankful for the people who quietly support us. Since that day, I’ve been more careful about noticing and appreciating such kindness . Every time I think of that Friday, I feel thankful to Valli not only for carrying my bag but also for showing me what real empathy looks like. She inspired me to be more helpful to others without expecting anything in return.

Senario : Help with Project Printout
It was just after Dasara holidays, and everyone was getting back to college routines. That evening, Vaishnavi ma’am reminded us that the printout of “Project Zero,” which was assigned before the holidays, had to be submitted the next morning — during the first period itself. My heart sank when I realized I hadn’t printed mine yet. I had completed the soft copy, but being in the hostel meant I had no access to a printer immediately, and it was already close to the shop’s closing time.
Most of my friends said that printing shop were about to close. It was one of those moments when everything seems to go wrong at once. My roommates were busy and I felt completely stuck. That’s when I thought of calling Rohith, one of my classmates was near the printing shop. I hesitated for a moment — it was already late, and I didn’t want to disturb him. But with no other option, I called.
To my surprise, he picked up immediately and listened patiently. Without even letting me finish, he said, “Send me the file right now; I’ll print it and give it to you tomorrow morning.” His tone was calm, reassuring, and kind. Within minutes, I sent him the soft copy. I couldn’t believe how quickly he agreed to help — no hesitation, no complaints.
The next morning, as promised, he handed me the printout, neatly done and stapled. I was filled with relief and gratitude. That simple act might seem small to others, but for me, it meant everything that day. Because of his help, I could submit the project on time and avoid unnecessary stress.
Later, I thanked him sincerely, and he just laughed and said, “No problem, you’d have done the same if I was stuck.” That response reflected true friendship — helping without expecting anything in return.
That day made me realize how powerful kindness can be. Sometimes, one thoughtful action can save someone from a lot of worry. I learned that gratitude isn’t only about saying “thank you” but also about remembering those moments and appreciating them deeply.
Even now, whenever I face stressful situations, I think of that night. It reminds me that I’m not alone and that there are people around me who genuinely care. I’m truly thankful to Rohith for being so responsive and reliable that day — for being that helping hand at just the right time.
