# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record

Scenario 1
Date: During Gokulashtami week
To  : CYS Seniors
  During Gokulashtami week, there was a lot of activity on campus for the celebrations.My friends and I were asked to chant a specific sloka for the main program. This was a problem because, we had never chanted in a program before.The sloka was short yet complex, and we just couldn't get it right. We kept mixing up the words, our timing was off, and we sounded hesitant and quiet. To make things worse, the program was less than a week away. We only had that "much time," and it was clear that our few attempts to practice on our own were a failure. We were getting really nervous about it, worried we would make mistakes in front of everyone. Our seniors were also helping to organize the event and were helping us directly. They rearranged their own schedules to find time to sit with us every single day that week.Their approach was incredibly patient and effective. They didn't just make us repeat the whole sloka over and over. They broke it down into small, manageable parts. First, they made sure we were pronouncing every single word correctly. They would chant one line, and we would repeat it. Not just once, More than fifteen times, until every one of us was saying it perfectly and in unison. They taught us where to take a breath, which words to emphasize, and how to maintain the rhythm of the chant. It was clear they had a deep understanding of the sloka, and they were transferring that knowledge to us piece by piece. I strongly believe they had to work harder than we did. We just had to learn the sloka, but they had to teach it. They had to listen to our mistakes, figure out why we were making them, and then patiently correct us. I wish to give my heartfelt gratitude to them for helping us in this event.

Scenario 2
Date: September
To : My Hackathon Teammates and Mentor
    Back in September, my team and I decided to participate in the Smart India Hackathon (SIH). It was a huge competition. Just being part of it was a big deal for us. Our team included Sreekanth, Arul, Midhun, Sathwika, and Rishijith. We were all excited, but we also knew how challenging it would be. We were incredibly fortunate to have Ramaguru sir as our SIH mentor.The competition was intense. We had a problem statement, and we had to build a presentation of our software solution from scratch. From the very beginning, Ramaguru sir was an essential part of our team. Before the hackathon even started, he met with us several times to help us select the problem statement and find what the govt and people actually wants from us. He didn't give us the answers, but he asked us questions that forced us to think more deeply about our project's logic, its users, and its potential flaws. His guidance was crucial in shaping our initial concept into something solid. Then we started working. Sreekanth was our leader, and he was completely focused, typing away for hours to build the backend logic and create a basic powerpoint presentation. Arul took on the role of searching for unique solutions, keeping us on schedule, and making sure all the different parts of the project would connect properly.Midhun was in charge of the front-end, and he did an amazing job designing a user interface that was clean, logical, and minimalistic.Sathwika handled all the research and documentation, she made sure our project was actually solving the problem statement and prepared all the written materials. Rishijith was responsible for the final presentation overview, he worked tirelessly alongside Sathwika to handle research and documentation.I was able to participate and contribute my part, but it was truly a group effort. There were stressful moments, like when we found a major flaw in one unique solution with only a 3 days left. But nobody panicked. We worked on it systematically and changed it. Ramaguru sir was available for us incase we asked to him to help us.I am just so very thankful to everyone involved. I'm thankful to Ramaguru sir for his mentorship and for believing in our team. And I'm deeply grateful to my teammates—Sreekanth, Arul, Midhun, Sathwika, and Rishijith. We couldn't have qualified without the contribution of every single person. This competition showed me how much we could achieve when we worked together. I am very thankful to everyone who helped me and my team.


Scenario 3
Date: Past 2 months
To  : Aditya, and all other friends
    I've been very lucky to be surrounded by kind and helpful friends, and I am very thankful to each and every one of them.A few weeks ago, I got sick. I had a high fever, and I was feeling awful, just lying in my hostel bed. Being sick when you're away from home feels ten times worse. I was in a very bad state. My friend from the hostel, Aditya, noticed I hadn't been to class and came by my room to check on me.He saw the state I was in, and without making a big deal out of it, he immediately went to help. He came back a few minutes later with medicine for my fever and, most importantly, his own personal flask filled with hot water. It meant everything. It wasn't just the medicine, it was the fact that he cared enough to check on me and then to bring me something of his own. It was a simple act of kindness that made a huge difference. I am, to this day, very thankful to him. Including him, each and every one of my friends has helped me experience a good college life. My roommates, for example, have been amazing. We live in a small space, but they've always been supportive. They've helped me study, woken me up when I've slept through an alarm, and just been good company. There have been many situations where I probably would have given up if I were alone, but they were there to help me through it. They've always been supportive.

You might expect a lot of competition, but I've found that most people are really helpful. We share notes, study together before exams, and help explain difficult topics to each other. Every person who has shown me kindness, even in small ways, has become a friend to me, and I know I can count on them. I'll definitely help them whenever I can, too.I am very thankful to all of them—my roommates, my classmates, and my close friends. They have all helped me in different ways, and they are the reason my college experience has been so positive so far.
