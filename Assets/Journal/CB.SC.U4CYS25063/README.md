# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind



## Journal Record

Throughout my short journey in Amrita of about 4 months i have encountered a lot of people who have taught me lot of important values and made me realise multiple
things about me, but from those people there are 3 people who struck me the most.

sri hari: I am really grateful that I got him as my friend. He is one of the few people I truly admire, especially for his dedication towards fitness and health. He’s someone I always look up to when it comes to discipline, body form, and overall balance in life.

During one sunday in the campus last month while most of us were spending our time binge-watching shows or sleeping late, he kept following his workout routine without fail. that morning, he invited me to join him for a quick workout session. Honestly, I was hesitant at first — I’m not used to waking up early or exercising regularly. But I decided to give it a try.I was working out without paying much attention to my form or technique. He noticed and came over to help me. Instead of giving a quick tip and leaving, he patiently corrected my posture, balance, breathing, and movement. He explained that maintaining the right form was more important than lifting heavy weights. He stayed beside me for a while, guiding me until I got it right. He is the reason that i am now able to do exercised properly.I’ve learned that  Sitting with a book 24/7 alone won’t take me far — maintaining my body and mind together is what will help me grow in the long run.
i am greatfull the he is helping me with my workout regularly .

srinivasan sir:
I want to express my gratitude to my Maths teacher, Srinivasan Sir, because when I think about dedication and genuine care for students, he is the first person who comes to mind. His commitment to making sure I truly understand every concept, no matter how complex, has always stood out to me.
There’s one particular incident that I will never forget. During one of our algebra lessons, I just couldn’t understand a certain concept no matter how many times I tried. I remember asking him the same doubt at least four or five times — each time expecting that he might get irritated or tell me to figure it out myself. But he never did. Every single time, he patiently explained it again, using a slightly different method each time until i understood it. I am truly grateful to have had a teacher like Srinivasan Sir. His patience, dedication, and belief in me have made a lasting impact, not only on how I learn but also on how I want to treat others in the future.hence i am greatfull that i got him as my teacher.
 
pranay:
Whether it’s deadlines, assignments, or exams comming  up, he never appears shaken.But the surprising thing was that when the results came, his work was always perfectly done. Everything was submitted on time, neat and correct. This made me realize that his calmness wasn’t laziness or indifference; it was confidence or trust in his ability to handle things when the time came.That attitude has greatly impacted me. Before meeting him, I linked productivity with pressure. I thought being serious, tense, and constantly worried was the only way to get things done. He showed me that being responsible doesn’t have to mean being stressed. Watching him manage things so smoothly made me rethink my whole approach.I started trying to adopt his mindset. When deadlines approached, instead of panicking, I tried to stay calm like him. At first, it was tough. My mind naturally tends to overthink—what if I forget something, what if I fail, what if I’m not good enough? But then I would look at him, completely relaxed, working step by step, and I’d realize that worrying doesn’t get the work done but Effort does. I began to understand that calmness isn’t the absence of effort, but the presence of clarity.
It was the night before physics exam. Everyone in our group chat was panicking. I was trying to revise everything at once, flipping through notes, highlighting random lines, and still feeling like I hadn’t learned anything. I asked, “How are you not stressed right now?” and he laughed and said, “Being stressed won’t make me remember more and dont try to panic yourself in the last moment. So I assured myself and ended up doing the exam well too. This is one practical incident where that attitude helped me.
