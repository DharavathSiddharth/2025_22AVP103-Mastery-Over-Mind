Topic: Three people I am grateful to have met in college
  1.My friend: Sahith I am  greatful to him. I met him in the college on first day of college.He is a joyful person.His encouragement helps me to adjust properly in the college.He helps me when I was feel stress and listen to me.he explains the topics that are doudt to me with out any hesitate.he always stays with me in difficult situations.Emotional Support and true friendship living with him has taught me the value of emotional support. College can be over, and I have faced my share of tough days. Whether it is stress from exams, homesicks, or the challenge of juggling everything, there have been times when I felt like I could not handle it with the helping hand. when i scored low marks in internal exams he motivated me to read well to score good marks in mid exams.he not only helped me in studies but also in playing games. he reminded me that I am not alone and that together we can face any problem. This kindness from her means a lot to me, especially in a place where I sometimes miss my family. I will always remember his inspiring words that keep motivating me to move forward in life.Spending time with him i realised that it is really important to take care of both our health and mind equally. I have been able to realise that sitting with a book 24/7 alone won't help you achive great heights , a good fitness is nessasary to maintain our energy and gain respect throught our success journey.

  
  2.My professor: Srinivasan sir I am thankful to Srinivas sir for motivating me. He not only taught the subject but also motivated me to improve communication skills and believe in my self.His commitment to helping us understand every concept no matter how complex and no matter how many times we ask doubts truly inspires me. He is very patient and listens to our doubts less regarded of how many times we ask it, this patience is what i aim to develop within myself.He believes in teaching us how to solve problems by understanding the root causes. This has helped me become more independent and responsible in my studies and life.Sir also guides us on how to manage our time well, balance studies and personal life, and work toward our goals steadily. I remember many times when I felt stressed about exams or projects, and sir words of encouragement helped me calm down and focus on my work. His advice about staying positive and working hard has left a strong impact on me.Apart from academic advice, srinivasan sir cares about our overall development. He organizes group activities, meetings, and events to bring us closer as classmate. Through these activities, we learn teamwork, leadership, and communication skills. Sir always encourages us to respect each others opinions, work together, and support our classmates, creating a friendly and positive environment in our class.He is very approachable and always available when we need him. I appreciate how sir never makes us feel rushed or ignored, no matter how busy he is. Whenever we visit him with questions or concerns, he gives us his full attention and treat our problems seriously. This shows how much he cares about our success and well-being.Srinivasan sir is also very disciplined and professional. He is always punchable, organizeable, and well preparable for meetings and discussions. His behavior teaches me the importance of discipline and responsibility in life. Watching his dedication motivates me to be serious and committed in my own work.Because of his constant support, I  gained more confidence in my studies and have become better at manage challenges. He encourages all students to believe in their abilities and not be afraid to ask for help.
