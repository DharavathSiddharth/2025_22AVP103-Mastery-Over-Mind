# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
My Gratitude journal:

1. It was one of those afternoons that tested every student’s willpower the class right after lunch. The combination of a full stomach of biriyani I ate in canteen with an apple juice to end it with, a dim classroom, and the slow hum of the ceiling fan can make even the most determined students struggle to stay awake. Today, I was particularly exhausted. The night before, I had been traveling back to college from my hometown, and the journey was long and tiring. I barely managed to get a few hours of sleep. My eyes felt heavy, and my body needed rest, but I had to attend the next class, taken by Srinivasan Sir, one of the most respected and understanding professors in our department. As I walked into the classroom, I could already sense the post-lunch drowsiness in the air. My classmates looked equally drained. I tried my best to focus, but within a few minutes, my eyelids began to droop. I wasn’t trying to be disrespectful, I genuinely couldn’t fight the tiredness that came from the sleepless night before. I had expected the usual like a warning if I closed my eyes for too long. But today, something different happened. Srinivasan Sir noticed my struggle. Instead of calling me out or embarrassing me in front of the class, he smiled and quietly ignored when I rested right at my desk at first bench. This might sound simple, but to me, it meant a lot. It showed understanding the kind that goes beyond rules and lectures. It showed that he cared more about the well being of his students than about strict discipline. I rested my head on the desk for a few minutes, feeling immense relief. It wasn’t about the short nap itself, it was the feeling of being seen and understood. That small act of kindness stayed with me much longer than any topic discussed that day. Teachers often have to maintain order and authority in class, but Sir managed to balance empathy with discipline perfectly. When I woke up after those few minutes, I felt surprisingly refreshed and even more motivated to listen to the rest of the lecture. I realized that understanding students mental and physical states is just as important as teaching them the syllabus. Srinivasan Sir didn’t just teach from the book; he taught through his actions: compassion, patience, and humanity. Later today, when I thought about it, I realized that this moment wasn’t about being allowed to sleep, it was about being treated with kindness. In college life, where deadlines, assignments, and expectations constantly pile up, small gestures like this make a huge difference. I often see students hesitating to express their tiredness or struggles because they fear being judged as lazy or careless. But Sir’s response reminded me that empathy is a powerful form of leadership. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that gratitude isn’t just about saying “thank you” It’s about recognizing how someone’s small action can have a lasting impact on your mindset. I don’t think Srinivasan Sir even remembers that moment, but I do. From next week, I will make sure to attend his class with full energy.

2. Next, It's the evening of 7th November, a small situation turned into a stressful experience, and it was Chitra Ma’am, my hostel warden, who helped me through it with kindness and empathy. It was a Thursday. The sky was slightly cloudy, it triggered a wave of homesickness within me. I had already been missing home for several days, but on that particular evening, the feeling became overwhelming. I decided that I needed to go home for the weekend. Being away from family for long periods is never easy, and sometimes the heart demands rest more than the body does. With this emotional urge to go home, I had already booked my travel tickets and I was relieved and excited that I would finally be able to meet my family the next day. As per the hostel rules, a gate pass has to be applied 24 hours in advance, and only after the warden approves it, we are allowed to leave the hostel premises. I opened my phone to submit the pass request around night time. That’s when things took a turn. My network decided to abandon me at the worst possible moment. The screen kept loading, refreshing, and showing “Network Error” repeatedly. I tried connecting to Wi-Fi, switching data on and off, even restarting the phone. Nothing worked. The pass application wouldn’t go through. Slowly, stress began to creep in. If the pass didn’t get approved before the deadline, I would not be allowed to travel, and my tickets and hope would go to waste. I could feel panic rising in my chest. My heart started beating faster as the thought of staying back in the hostel during the weekend felt unbearable. I wasn’t just missing home, I truly needed that break for my emotional well being. Without thinking much, I rushed to the warden’s office, hoping she would still be there. My mind was filled with “What if she refuses?”, “What if she scolds me for being late?”, “What if she thinks I’m careless?”. The door to her office was slightly open. I gently knocked and entered, feeling anxious and breathless from the rush. Chitra Ma’am looked up from her desk. She immediately noticed the panic on my face. I explaine my situation how I had booked my ticket, how I had tried applying for the pass, and how the network issue had stopped me from submitting it 24 hours earlier as required. I expected a disappointed expression or a lecture about following rules. Instead, she calmly gestured for me to sit down. Her voice was soft, almost reassuring, when she asked me to relax and explain slowly. She listened to every detail patiently. There was no irritation, no blame, no judgement, just understanding. After I finished, she smiled gently and said, “It’s okay. These things happen. Don’t panic. I will approve it. You can go home tomorrow.”. In that moment, relief washed over me. I felt like someone had lifted a heavy weight off my shoulders. Her tone, more than her words, comforted me. It wasn’t just about approving a pass, it was the emotional support she gave me when I was struggling. She could have easily said, “Rules are rules. I can’t help.” Many people hold onto rules without considering the human side behind them. But Chitra Ma’am showed that rules are meant to guide, not to punish, especially when the situation is genuine. It made me appreciate the kind of person she is, someone who values understanding and fairness over strict rules. That night, I returned to my room with a calm heart. I was grateful, not just because I could go home, but because I learned something meaningful about handling stressful situations. I realised how quickly panic can take over, clouding your ability to think. But when we meet the right kind of people, those who choose empathy over authority the situation becomes easier to navigate. Later, as I lay in bed thinking about everything, I reflected on the incident. Many times, when things go wrong, our first instinct is to stress or overthink. But that day, I understood that reacting calmly and approaching the right person with honesty can solve problems without unnecessary fear. I also learned that good people exist, and they are willing to help if we communicate respectfully and genuinely. The next day, when I left for home, I silently thanked her once again. That journey felt more peaceful. The warmth of going home felt even more special because it was made possible by someone’s kindness.

3. Finally to Ramaguru Sir. Our Section A had been struggling with one particular subject for a while. The issue was not with the subject itself, but with the teaching pace and lack of clarity in the portions. Concepts felt rushed, explanations seemed incomplete, and many of us were unsure about what to focus on for our exams. It wasn’t anyone’s fault entirely, but the gap between teaching and understanding kept growing. Slowly, doubt and anxiety began to creep in among the students. By the time of our midterm, the situation got worse. Many students didn’t perform as expected, including me. I felt particularly disappointed because I had genuinely tried to study, but I never felt confident about what I had learned. Seeing the question paper only confirmed my fear that I had failed to understand the subject properly. At that time entered Ramaguru Sir. He was known for being approachable, calm, and student-friendly. Still, we was nervous. Approaching a faculty member to discuss concerns about another subject could easily be misunderstood as complaining or blaming. But the intention was not to point fingers it was to seek clarity and find a way to learn better. Sir arrived to speak to us after regular class hours. That itself showed his willingness to help, taking extra time beyond his schedule to listen to us. After 5 PM, we all stayed back because this discussion mattered to us. When Sir entered the classroom, he walked in with a gentle smile, stood near the desk, and simply said, “Alright, tell me what’s happening.” His tone itself made everyone feel comfortable enough to speak honestly. One by one, students started sharing their concerns. Some mentioned the fast-paced teaching, others spoke about doubts not being clarified, and some openly admitted they were scared to even ask questions in class. What impressed me most was the way Sir listened. He didn’t interrupt, didn’t judge, and didn’t rush to respond. He heard us fully. For 20–25 minutes, he let us express every concern. It felt like a safe space something students don’t often get in academic environments. I too shared how the unclear portions had affected my confidence, especially after seeing my midterm paper. Sir nodded thoughtfully. After everyone had finished speaking, he exhaled softly and said something that instantly made us feel lighter, “I understand what you are saying. The portions should never feel confusing. And don’t worry, the topics are actually simple. If you want, I can teach you those again myself.” Those words struck me. There was no ego, no defensiveness, no excuses—just empathy and a willingness to help. A teacher offering to personally reteach a subject, outside scheduled hours, is not a small thing. It reminded me that some teachers genuinely care about students understanding, not just syllabus completion. For me personally, that conversation shifted something inside. Until that point, I had been feeling guilty and disappointed for not performing well. I had convinced myself that maybe I wasn’t capable enough. But Sir helped me see that the issue was not my ability, but the situation. I walked out of the classroom that evening feeling understood, relieved, and motivated. The stress that had been sitting on my mind for days slowly started to dissolve. I felt hopeful again. More importantly, I learned a valuable lesson about communication. If we keep problems to ourselves, we only multiply our stress. But when we express our concerns sincerely to the right person, solutions emerge. Sir taught us that teachers are not barriers, they are guides, but they can only guide when students open up. That discussion strengthened the student-teacher relationship for our entire class. The next time we had doubts, we didn’t hesitate to talk to the concerned faculty, and gradually the learning environment became healthier. Therefor I,m truly grateful to Sir for his kind action and words.
