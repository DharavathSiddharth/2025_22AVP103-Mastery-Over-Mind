## Journal Record
Scenario 1: Gratitude to Ramguru Sir 
I am greatly indebted to Ramguru Sir he is one of the most understanding and encouraging teachers that ever existed in my life. The incident took place during our internal Smart India Hackathon (SIH) selections and it became a great source of learning for me on the subject of responsibility, forgiveness, and leadership.
Our team was putting forth all their efforts to find a creative and the most feasible idea for the hackathon. So, in total, days were consumed in brainstorming, refining our proposal, and doing everything else to get the final product. On the day when the form for the internal round submission was due, I had been assigned the task of feeding in the details of our group. Owing to the excitement and the rush, I unfortunately did a blunder while filling out the form and entered wrong information about the roll numbers and names which made the form invalid. The form was crucial since it would hold the official data of all the participants.
When I got to know about my mistake, it was already too late. I was quite tensed, guilty my mistake was such a big one that it would not just affect the team but also we would not be able to participate. Everyone on the team was not happy, but they didn’t point the finger at me instead, they urged me to go to the Ramguru Sir and tell him what had happened. To begin with i was very reluctant as I anticipated being rebuked or even barred from the competition but  when I finally gathered the guts to meet him, he patiently heard me out make me realise my mistake and allow my team to participate.

Scenario 2: Gratitude to a M.Tech Senior 
cybersec was so vast and so confusing it had an overwhelming number of tools, concepts, and platforms. At that time one of our MTech seniors recognized our interest and decided to help us. Instead of keeping his knowledge to himself.
What made his efforts truly special was that he didn’t have to do any of it he wasnt being paid or assigned by the faculty, he simply wanted to make life easier for others and share knowledge. Seeing someone so selfless help juniors made me realize the power of community learning and mentorship.
Personally this boosted my motivation to learn cybersecurity seriously and in a disciplined manner. That made me value how one persons initiative positively affects so many others. 
 I learned that the real way in which learning occurs is through the support of each other not by trying to outdo someone. It also taught me the value of paying it forward. one day I hope to be able to do the same for others as he did with us. I will always be grateful for how he took the time to create a space where young cybersecurity enthusiasts like me could grow and learn together

Scenario 3: Gratitude for Saurabh Sir
Im thankful to him for teaching complex topics and tools such as Wireshark and Burp Suite in a way that is simple, clear, and engaging.
Before attending his classes, I used to find cybersecurity tools intimidating. I would often hear terms like “packet capture” “intercepting traffic”  and assume they were too advanced for me to understand he broke down every topic step by step ensuring that everyone in class understood the fundamentals before moving to complex parts.
His classes were never just about theory, he demonstarted how tools like wireshark capture and analyze packets, and how burpsuite can be used to test web application security. Every concept was backed with realworld examples thats what made his lessons memorable.
 I often asked many basic quetions but he never once made me feel hesitant or embarrassed. He encouraged curiosity and created an environment where students could explore freely. 
Thanks to him and his practicals classes now i have a deeper interest in this subject.
