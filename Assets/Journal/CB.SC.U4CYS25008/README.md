## Journal Record
good evening iam pranav from the cybersecurity branch of section A held by the roll number CB.SC.U4CYS25008 
after joining here from the frist day iam greatful for some people from our clg who have helped me from things

1. my frist frnd in amrita whose name is pranay he is from rajahmundry.on the day of gokulashtami I got to know him when I was sitting alone on the bench near the ground he came to me asked my name and branch so that he could be in touch . after few days the section segregation has completed this turned to be him in my section . on a fine day when I was feeling low he is the only one who noticed from my friends circle and offered his time for me and spent time with to chear me up so that it would be nice . at that time he tried to crack some jokes and even gathered everyone to lighten me up . he was with me all the time giving good advice and try to make me feel good again.

2.Our HOD sir Mr.sethumadhavan sir who was a very busy person in our college even when we tried to give a complaint sir used to be very busy so we would come again and try.but one day in the morning when we came early to the class room sir saw us and came to take a review of the teachers and other facilities.so, at that time I shared my problem with sir that the transportation time for our campus to mess in the lunch time . we would have 1 hour of lunch break and 20 min to travel from campus to the mess then again which would take like 40 min in the hour and 20 to eat and in that 20 min we would have to stand in the line to get the lunch.so i asked sir that is it possible to arrange any busses from our campus to the mess. sir said that he would resolve the issue inspite of his busy schedule he had really turned down the problem of transportation in the afternoon.

3.My senior from another branch Pushpak . despite being a freshman he approached me very well and got introduced to and exchanges our numbers . one day he called me out to show the whole amrita campour on a tour out of respect I went with him then he showed me the gym . and asked would I like to go to the gym and get ripped . and I thought why not so from next day he would only call to me to the gym after going there he would say exercise very precisely with correction as it would effect my body and he also gave me some advices on diet to follow like eat 2 eggs daily and eat the curry more than rice . while going to my room he gave me resources that would help me in my studies like he gave me a prior information to learn about any programming languages.

meeting this three people in my intermediate level is more meaningful and fulfilling. they have contributedmin improve and getting a great attitude from myself.
