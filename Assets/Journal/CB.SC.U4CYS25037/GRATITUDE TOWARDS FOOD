I am really thankful for the canteens in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.
our campus is far away from Coimbatore, we never feel like we are missing out on anything because canteen food always is up to the mark.
The variety of the food and the neat surroundings, and friendly staff make every meal special. 
I am grateful to the people in the background who work hard every day, cooking and billing, no matter how hot or busy it gets. 
Sometimes, after long classes a simple cup of tea or a plate with egg puffs from the canteen tastes soo good. 
I really appreciate how canteens provide taste, fresh food and take care of so many students .
It reminds me that gratitude is not just for big things but also for the small everyday moments like this.
