I feel very thankful for all my teachers here at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.
They teach us something new with so much patience every day, taking such good care. 
They make difficult concepts feel so easy .
I really admire the way you guide us teaching us to be kind, humble, and confident. 
Sometimes even a small smile or one or two words from you make a big difference in my whole day.
I am grateful to have such hardworking and supportive teachers as yourselves. 
Thank you for being an important part of my journey.
