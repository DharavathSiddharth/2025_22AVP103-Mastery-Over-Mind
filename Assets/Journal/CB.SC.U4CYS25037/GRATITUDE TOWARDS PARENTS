I feel really thankful for my parents, who have always been my biggest support in each and every step.
They are the reason I am able to study at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham .
I know how much they have sacrificed so that I can have a good education and a happy life. 
Whenever I feel tired or stressed, thinking about their pain gives me strength
I am grateful for their patience, their hard work, and the way they always understand me even when I don’t say much. 
My parents are my greatest blessing, and I hope to make them proud one day. 
Thank you, Amma and Appa, for everything, for your love and support.
