1. Gratitude to Mahilesh:


When I joined college, I was both excited and scared. Everything felt new. The campus was large, the crowd was unfamiliar, and I didn’t know how I would adjust to this different environment. The first few weeks were full of confusion and anxiety. I struggled to find my classes, remember names, and handle the new subjects. I often felt lost. During this time, I met Mahilesh, a person whose energy and positivity transformed my college life.

At first, I didn’t realize he would become such an important part of my daily routine. He was cheerful and always smiling, which made everyone around him feel comfortable. What I appreciate most about him is how he can bring laughter even during tough times. When I was struggling to fit in, his presence made everything feel lighter.

There was one day I will never forget. It was right after our internal exams. I had worked hard for a subject I found difficult, yet I received a disappointing score. I remember sitting quietly in the canteen, trying to hide my frustration. Mahilesh came over, noticed my expression, and instead of saying anything serious, he joked about how the exam paper seemed like it was written in another language. He made up funny stories about how even the teacher might have been confused while creating the paper. It was silly, yet I couldn’t help but laugh. In that moment, my sadness disappeared. That’s what Mahilesh does. He doesn’t lecture or give advice. He simply lightens the mood.

Over time, I understood that his humor isn’t just about jokes. It’s a way for him to show he cares. Whenever someone in our group feels down, he’s the first to notice and act. Once, I saw him cheering up a friend who was feeling homesick. He didn’t mention home or sadness. Instead, he distracted him with random stories, helping him forget his loneliness for a while. Seeing that made me realize how much of a difference one person’s positive energy can make. 

What I’ve learned from Mahilesh is that happiness doesn’t mean life is perfect. He faces his own challenges, but he never lets them dull his spirit. There were times I found out he was dealing with personal issues, yet he would still show up smiling and uplifting others. His strength to remain positive even when times are tough is something I admire deeply. 

Before college, I thought being serious was the only way to handle problems. But Mahilesh taught me that sometimes, the best approach is to laugh at life’s complications. He showed me that a simple smile can change not only your day but also someone else’s.

Looking back, I see how important he has been in shaping my attitude. Whenever I feel low, I remember his words: "Nothing’s that deep, da. Just breathe." It sounds simple, but it holds so much meaning.

My gratitude for Mahilesh isn’t just about the laughter he brings. It’s about the lightness he adds to life. He makes college feel less stressful and reminds me that even during hard times, there’s always room for a smile. People like him are rare—genuine, cheerful, and endlessly kind. I’ll always be thankful that I met him when I needed a reason to smile.



2. Gratitude to Ashwin Sai:

The first day of college was one of the most nerve-wracking experiences of my life. I remember sitting in the lecture hall, surrounded by new faces, feeling awkward and silent. I wasn’t sure how to talk to anyone. Everyone seemed busy making friends, while I sat quietly, pretending to look at my phone. Then, a friendly voice broke the silence: "Hey, is this seat taken?" It was Ashwin Sai. That simple question marked the start of a friendship that would change my college journey.

Ashwin sat beside me, and within minutes, he initiated a conversation. I was surprised at how easy it was to talk to him. He didn’t make things formal or awkward; he treated me like we had known each other for a long time. From that moment, things felt a bit easier.

In the first few weeks, I struggled socially. I’ve always been a bit reserved and hesitant to start conversations. But Ashwin didn’t let that continue for long. He would pull me into group discussions, lab activities, or random chats. He introduced me to his circle, and soon, I became a part of it too. He has a natural ability to include people, making it easier for me to open up.

Thanks to him, I began participating in events, interacting with classmates, and enjoying college life more. He showed me that socializing isn’t as scary as I thought; it’s about being open to people who care.

When I reflect on my first day—the shy, silent version of myself—and compare it to now, I see how much Ashwin has contributed to my growth. He transformed my college experience from something fearful into something joyful.

I’m deeply grateful to him—not just because he was my first friend, but because he became the bridge that connected me to a world of friendships, laughter, and confidence. He taught me that kindness can change people. Without him, I might still be sitting alone in the corner.



3. Gratitude to Lokesh and Yashwanth:

When I joined college, I was nervous about studies and communication. As a Tamil student, I worried about connecting with classmates from other states. That fear came true when I met Lokesh and Yashwanth, both Telugu-speaking students. At first, I thought it would be hard to talk to them. But today, they are two of my closest friends—proof that real friendship doesn’t depend on language.

Initially, our conversations were awkward. I mixed English and Tamil; they mixed English and Telugu. Sometimes we both laughed when we didn’t understand each other. Rather than letting that be a problem, we made it fun. We created our own version of "college language"—half-English, half-everything else—and it somehow worked.

Slowly, we started spending more time together—doing assignments, having lunch, and walking back to the hostel after class. Our bond grew strong because they were genuine. Even if I didn’t understand something, they never made me feel left out. They would patiently explain or switch languages to ensure I felt comfortable. 

We’ve shared many small moments that mean a lot—study sessions that turned into laughter, inside jokes that made no sense, and even debates over who makes the best tea. These small moments built a bond that words can’t describe.

What amazes me most is their effort. They taught me Telugu phrases, and I taught them Tamil words. Sometimes we challenged each other to speak only in the other’s language for a day—it was chaotic but hilarious. That’s how our friendship grew—through effort, laughter, and mutual respect. 

They taught me that connection is about understanding, not just communication. I learned that kindness and empathy can cross any barrier. Even with our differences, we found a rhythm that felt natural.

Today, I can proudly say that Lokesh and Yashwanth are my family away from home. They showed me that real friendship doesn’t need translation—it’s felt through actions, not just words. I’m endlessly grateful for the warmth they’ve given me and the memories we’ve built together.
