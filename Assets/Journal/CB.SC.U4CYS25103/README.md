# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
To: -  My friends
Date :- 12th August 2025
My friends, some of the moments with my friends in amrita were one of the happiest, funniest and memorable moments of my life. It was chill, chaotic and very risky but fun and messing with each other, helping each other and also being there for someone when they need you the most, never made me alone or lonely in my life and taught me the importance of true friendship. I am a shy and awkward person when it comes to meeting new people and trying to be friends with them but after seeing how easy it was to make friends with the guys in Amrita i don't feel shy or awkward anymore and its honestly been fun. So i am thankful to my friends. I met few of them first by sitting next to some ( obviously ) and they were from tamil nadu and i was a malayali but i did not struggle to become their friends becuase they were really chill and fun and vibe filled and some of them shared similar interests of mine which made us become friends much easier. Through funny and crude jokes to playing mobile games like bgmi and all together and then calling each other through nicknames and then blaming each one for being "TOPPER" and othe fun activities we became good friends. Then through lab groups assigned which were according to roll numbers, i also got to know those people and became well connected to them as well through whatsapp groups discussing about project works and all and then sharing memes, and funny jokes. The thing was i thought up until then that i could only become friends with 2 to 3 people max and above that was not possible for someone like me who feels tireed after a long time of talking with friends, but strangely i didnt struggle here and most of the people i spoke to were easy to get around and also i did find people who are like me or a more introverted versions some were there who were straight up eccentric and enigmatic but yea kind and friendly at the end of the day and i never thought i could become friends with people who are that chaotic but good at heart. At the end of the day i'm thankful to my friends ( there are many so its hard to name everyone and if i did try to name some, the people i didn't mention might get hurt :) ), for being chill around someone like me and not trying to bully or rag me for who i am.

Second the highly qualified and friendly faculties of Amrita who teach really well and are not scary or strict but are chill approachable and very helpful. I had a totally opposite view of them before attending their first class, especially cyber security essentials sir but turns out he's a chill and nice sir who also teaches very well and is very helpful although he could be a bit scary as an invigilator. Its not that everyone is chill ( Some really strict teachers are there sure :) ) but yea most of them are cool. What made me surprised was that i always hated history, forget history anything related to social ... but for the subject "Foundations of Indian heritage" the way karthik sir taught it, i found it very interesting and surprisingly i was able to understand and like it easily and i realised history can be really interesting if taught in the right way and the only reason i hated this in the past was because it was taught in the most boring way possible ( Textbook reading, by heart it and vomit whatever you know in the exam paper ), but karthik sir showed how even the most boring subject has the most interesting stuff ( its only the only subject in the mid sem which i got above 40 :) ). Then there is the POE class which is really interesting .

Third, the class advisors, although i have not personally went and spoke to them or anything but i know they are ready to support or help us whenever required for the whole class and also make sure we are updated with new rules or anything and sudden twists that could happen ( i mean sudden exam announcement or something ). They are friendly and approachable as well. There was one situation where we needed one advisrors help as soon as possible and one of the advisors heard to all of our problems patiently and he asked various questions about it to be sure out problem was a genuine one or not. Then he took the required action and also explained that he understood our concerns and was ready to help us with it but he also pointed at us where we should change and that we should shift a bit from school mentality to college students maturity and over time we realised he was right. He knew we did face problems but he also pointed where we had to change and through that we understood where our weakness were and where we had to understand even we have to change. 

Last but not the least, the lab assistants. One of the labs for us is really confusing even though we have the theory knowledge of it since all the connections and practical stuff gets confusing a lot sometimes but the lab assistants spend their time explaining us how each thing works and how it all connects and how the theory knowledge is the main base for it and due to their crucial help during times like these, we know we are safe for lab evaluation and won't get a zero or just end up standing there like a fool. They also sometimes struggle but they make sure at the end we get the correct connections and stuff and they are super helpful althought the only concern is there might be only 1 or 2 lab assistants sometimes so a person or 2 more could be helpful. Otherwise they are cool.
