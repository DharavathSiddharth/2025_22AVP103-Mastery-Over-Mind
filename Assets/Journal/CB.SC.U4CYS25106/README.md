# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal 

27 August 2025

Today I was reminded how even small acts of kindness can change your whole day. My morning started very well : Amriteshwari ma’am allowed me to join the CSE students’ group for the Ganesh Chaturthi bhajans. It might seem like a little thing, but it honestly meant a lot to me. The group was only for CSE students, and I’m not one, so I never thought I’d be allowed to perform with them . But she still included me, and that made me feel at home. The bhajans brought such a peaceful vibe—they were a real break from all the usual college stress. I realized being included isn’t just about being in the group, but about feeling noticed and accepted for who you are. Her small gesture showed me that real leadership can be quiet, just about caring and thinking about others.

Later, something even smaller but just as nice happened—the bus uncle let me hop in at the very last second. I was late and thought I’d totally missed it, but he saw me and stopped, waving me in to get in fast. I wasn’t just glad I’d make it to lunch—I felt genuinely thankful that there are people who go a little out of their way for you, even when they don’t have to. He didn’t have to wait, but he did. That little moment made me realize how important these quiet acts of kindness really are.

In class, another instance of generosity came from my classmate sitting to my left. I had missed some parts of the PSAT lesson earlier, and while I was trying to write down my lecture notes from my memory, she helped me by explaining the concept step by step. She didn’t just summarize the notes — she taught it in a way that made sense to me. It was such a subtle but meaningful gesture; she could have focused entirely on her own work, yet she chose to make sure I caught up. In academic life, these small exchanges mean everything — instead of seeing me as a competition, she genuinely helped me. I think that’s something I’ve come to truly appreciate about my class environment: the willingness of people to lift each other up, even when there’s no reward attached.

By the end of the day, I realized that the moments I felt most thankful for were the small ones—like a teacher including me, a driver waiting for me, or a classmate quietly helping out. None of these were big or dramatic, but together they made my day feel really special. It was just a bunch of simple, genuine kindness from people who probably didn’t even know how much it mattered.

4th November 2025

Today’s reflections are centered around helpfulness — the kind that seems to appear just when it’s needed. My classmate to the right made my day easier. I had been struggling to figure out the functions of the scientific calculator; the symbols and operations still seemed unnecessarily complex to me. She saw I was confused and offered to explain. The last time I remember, only my amma could understand from my face whether I was confused due to something or not, without me even having to ask. She showed me how to use the basic and advanced features with really good patience. It wasn’t just about learning how to use a tool — it was about learning through someone’s willingness to share what they know. It reminded me that teaching and helping don’t always happen between a teacher and student; it’s may be a bit more comfortable to learn from your friends compared to a teacher (respectfully)

Over the past few weeks, I’ve started to notice that being thankful isn’t just about big things. Most of the time, it’s the small stuff that makes a difference—like people who show up for you, even in little ways. One thing I really appreciate is my group of friends who call me every week, no matter how busy they are. It might not seem like a big deal, but it means a lot to me.

These days, everyone’s got their own stuff going on, and it’s pretty easy to lose touch. But my friends never let that happen. Their weekly calls are something I actually look forward to. It’s a simple space to just talk, laugh, and share what’s going on. It’s nice knowing someone is out there who cares enough to ask, “How are you?”

It’s these small things that make me realize friendship isn’t just about having fun together—it’s about checking in and being there. Sometimes I wonder if I’m doing enough for them, too, but their effort reminds me that real friendships work both ways. It feels good to know that we all care about each other.

Even short calls make a big difference. Just hearing familiar voices, especially on tough days, reminds me I’m not alone. I’ve learned that you don’t have to talk all the time to stay close—just making a little effort matters a lot. Their kindness has also made me want to be more thoughtful with the people I care about.

Another thing that stuck with me happened at college, not long ago. I was really stressed about my marks in one subject and didn’t know how to tell my parents. I tried to act normal in class, but Vaishnavi ma’am noticed something was off. Even though she was busy, she took a moment to quietly ask if I was okay. Since others were around, I just said I was fine.

Later, when I was leaving, she asked again if I was alright. This time, I told her what was bothering me. She listened and told me it’s normal not to ace every subject, and that one score doesn’t decide my future. Her words didn’t fix everything, but they helped me see things differently. It genuinely helped me to decrease my stress levels a bit. What meant a lot was that she actually noticed and cared enough to check in again.

Amit sir also helped me when I was worried about POE. He took the time to explain things until I understood, and even though he seems strict, he really wants us to learn for real, not just for the marks. Having teachers like him and Vaishnavi ma’am has changed how I see study and exams—they remind me that it’s okay to ask for help and that doing your best is what counts.

Looking back, it’s these simple moments—friends calling, teachers checking in—that show what real support looks like. It’s not about big speeches or grand gestures. Most of the time, it’s just about someone noticing how you’re feeling or remembering to ask how things are going.

I’ve realized that being grateful isn’t about counting all the good things, but actually noticing them as they happen. It’s about the people who make things lighter when life feels heavy. These small things and the people behind them are what make regular days feel special.

On 8th November I was grateful to the Nadam club coordinator for being so approachable and giving both me and Appu a chance to perform, even if it was just for a short while, on Diwali. It really meant a lot to us to be included, especially since we hadn’t expected to get this opportunity. Being able to take part in the celebration together made the day even more special for both of us.



5 August 2025

Today was different from most days. The university celebrated Onam, and right from the morning, things felt special. The campus was decorated, people were wearing traditional clothes, and you could just feel that everyone was a bit more excited than usual.

The best part was the Onam sadhya in the mess. I went there with my friends. The mess staff had arranged everything really well, and there was a long line, but no one seemed to mind. Everyone was talking, laughing, and waiting for their turn. I hadn’t eaten like that in a long time. The food was simple but really good. It reminded me of family functions back home, where everyone sits together and eats. For once, I didn’t think about missing home. I just enjoyed the moment, eating with my friends, listening to everyone talk, and just being there.

After lunch, there were some Onam games and activities. I had always wanted to try one of these games. I tried a few of the traditional games. Some of them were easy, some were a bit confusing since I’d never played them before, but it was fun. People were cheering each other on, and even if someone lost, everyone laughed it off. It wasn’t about winning or losing. It was just about being part of the fun. I met a few new people, too. We joked around and made plans to play again next year. I realized I hadn’t felt that relaxed in a while. The people who organized the events really thought of everything. They made sure everyone felt welcome and included, and it was nice to see so many people from different backgrounds coming together and enjoying the day.

What made the day even better was having a day off from classes. There was nothing to rush for, no assignments to worry about, and no strict schedules. I spent some time just walking around the campus. Everywhere I looked, there were people taking photos, chatting in groups, or just enjoying the break. Some of my friends were showing off their simple Onam outfits, and we took a lot of pictures together. I saw people sharing food, helping each other with the games, and just being kind to one another. It was a nice change from the usual routine where everyone is busy with their own work and doesn’t have much time to talk.

Later in the day, I met up with a few friends near the hostel. We talked about the food, the games, and even joked about how we should have more days like this. Some of us shared stories about how Onam is celebrated at home, and it was interesting to hear the different ways people celebrate the same festival. No one was trying to impress anyone else. We were just sharing little bits of our lives. I could tell that everyone appreciated the effort the university put into making the day special.

As the day went on, I noticed that the usual stress and homesickness I felt sometimes just weren’t there. Maybe it was because I was busy, or maybe it was because I was surrounded by people who felt the same way. Either way, I felt lighter. There was a simple happiness in the air. It wasn’t about big celebrations or expensive things. It was just about being together, eating good food, playing games, and enjoying a break from the usual rush.

By the end of the day, I felt a quiet kind of happiness. I was glad to have friends to enjoy the day with, and I appreciated the staff and students who worked hard to put everything together. It was nice to have a day that didn’t feel like just another day at university. It felt a little more special, and I think everyone needed that. I thought about how days like this don’t come often, but when they do, they make a big difference.

I’m someone who usually gets excited about festivals or big events. It’s easy to get lost in studies and routines, but taking some time to just enjoy with friends and be part of something on campus is important too.I hope the university keeps doing things like this. It helps students who are far from home feel a bit more settled, and it gives everyone a break from the usual pressure. Even if things go back to normal tomorrow, I’ll remember this day for a long time. It was simple, fun, and just what I needed.

Most of all, even though we were told not to write this, I’m really grateful to my parents for letting me study here. I’m also thankful to Appu for always helping me, even though I am a trouble. And above all, I’m grateful to God for always being there for me, for anything and everything, and keeping me safe.

Sorry to those whom I might have forgotten to mention.
Maybe words aren't enough to express my gratitude for you.
