# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind

## Journal Record
Date: November 11, 2025
Today, I would like to thank:

Dr Chungath Srinivasan, my Maths professor: 
His patience and thorough explanations in class are greatly appreciated. He makes learning easier and always encourages us to ask questions and clarifies it in understandable way. This week, his teaching over a hard topic was appreciable and understandable.

Sanjai, my friend: 
I value Sanjai's constant follow-up to encourage me and share notes prior to tests. When I'm feeling anxious, I can rely on him for moral support and group discussions.

Advik and Tejashree , my class representative: 
I appreciate both for informing everyone about due dates and assignments. Both always takes accountability seriously and keeps the class cohesive.

Reflection:
Today reminded me how much easier college life becomes with supportive people around. Each person contributes in their own way — through teaching, friendship, or leadership. I feel thankful to be surrounded by such encouraging individuals.
