# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
To Srinivasan Sir: Attending your Math classes this semester has been an exceptional start to my journey with the subject. I used to find mathematics uninteresting and often lacked the motivation to study it compared to my other courses. However, your teaching approach and passion for the subject during August 2025 completely transformed my perspective. Thanks to your guidance, I am now beginning to appreciate why math holds such a special place for so many. Although my performance in the recent mid-terms was not up to the mark, I’m confident that, under your mentorship, I will make significant progress in the coming months. he even made me sit seperetely in front of the front row, so that i would stay focused during classes and score grades in the exams.

 To Sibi sir –
I truly appreciate Sibi sir for being such a warm and approachable person. His friendly nature makes interactions easy and comfortable, encouraging open conversations and free exchange of ideas. His support and positivity have helped me gain confidence and stay motivated in my studies. I admire his patience, clarity in communication, and the respect he shows to everyone around him. People like him leave a meaningful and lasting impression on those they meet.

To my friend- Today, I am especially grateful for my friend Aadi, whose support makes a real difference in my life. Aadi has always helped me with assignments, explaining concepts patiently and sharing tips whenever anything seemed difficult to grasp while studying. Such a friend by my side gives me the courage and confidence to face academic challenges head-on because I know I am not alone.
Beyond academics, I really cherish our friendship because Aadi is kind and always tries to help. He has made the stressful times lighter and easier to manage. It is seldom that one gets a friend who can be a good study partner and also a loyal companion. Shared moments of laughter, conversations, and encouragement are always remembered, and I am really grateful for the presence of Aadi in my life.
Looking back, I realize how much Aadi's friendship motivates me to do better and believe in myself. I hope to support and appreciate Aadi just as much, for such friends are a blessing and should be celebrated every day.
