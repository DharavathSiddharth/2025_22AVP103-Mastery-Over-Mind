# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
Scenario 1:

Date: 2 weeks after coming to amrita

Gratitude towards my Roommates

Just two weeks after entering Amrita, I suddenly fell ill with a high fever. Being away from home, this was a particularly difficult experience for me. The comfort and care of my family was not there and I initially felt a wave of helplessness. However, I received help and support from my friends. Even though we had known each other for only a short while ( 2 weeks) , my roommates, they didn’t hesitate to help me when I needed it. They immediately came to check on me, made sure I was comfortable, and took me to the doctor. I remember how they waited patiently while the doctor examined me and helped me get my medicines from the pharmacy. They also made sure I ate properly and got enough rest. They even called my mother and told her my entire situation and helped me get better. It was an unforgettable experience for me. I feel deeply grateful for their compassion and the genuine concern they showed.

Numerical solving in physics - Before going to the Mid-Term exams

Gratitude towards 2 of my friends

I am grateful to two of my friends - Ruchika and Jerush

Right before the mid-term physics exam I ended up in a troublesome situation. Physics has always been a subject with which I stuggle no matter how easy the topic is, especially the numerical problems which can sometimes be tricky and require a deep conceptual understanding. As the exams approached, I found myself struggling with a few types of problems that the professors had discussed in class just before the exams. Despite revising them multiple times, I couldn’t grasp the logic behind some of the numericals. That’s when two of my classmates, Ruchika and Jerush, stepped in to help me.

Both of them were very clear with those concepts, and they patiently explained the reasoning behind each problem statement. They didn’t just give me the solutions, they helped me understand why certain methods were used in certain problems and why they were not used in another and how to approach those questions to get marks even if my calculations went wrong here and there. During the exam, I was able to apply the same methods we had discussed and that made a huge difference in my performance. It is not only in this subject, but math as well. I always have a healthy conversation and discussion with them on not only these subjects but also in the rest. They ask me what they don't understand and I ask them on what I don't. In the process I got to know a lot of different things about not only course subjects but also on various other topics.

I would also like to thank my other friends who interact with me in a friendly manner. Despite my shortcomings while speaking in a different language, they never teased me or made me feel bad or ignored me but rather helped me with how to speak it better in that language. This situation happened when I tried to speak in Hindi.
Even though Hindi was my second language I struggle to speak it fluently. I would like to thank my friends who despite my incorrect Hindi sentence framing didn't mind it and also helped me frame it better. With their assistance I gradually became more fluent in speaking Hindi.
Whenever I needed some outside assistance in any of my problems my friends were always there to help me. 

Scenario 2:

Date: 3 weeks back

Gratitude towards my family
I would like to express my deepest gratitude towards my mother. The Mid-Term exams were approaching and so was Diwali. Weeks before the exams, I and my friends had planned our Diwali break according to the academic calender. At that time for CYS students, there was a sudden change in the exams plans. We had already booked a ticket for 5 days. Instead of the dates we had originally seen in the academic calendar, the exams were rescheduled in such a way that shortened our break to only 3 days. Our five-day Diwali vacation was now reduced to only three days. The booking was done for not only me but also for 3 other friends. I became anxious. Not only because of the change in the break but also on returning home as I had an exam the day right after the next day of Diwali. I knew if I were to return home at that point I won't be able to study and so I and the others even thought of not going back home. It was a sudden notice to me and my friends and my mother. 

My mother convinced me to come to home for Diwali no matter what and that she will take care of it. She immediately started looking for alternatives. She contacted with my friend's parents and helped arrange a different plan. Despite being very busy with her work, she booked a last minute ticket for me and my friends through a different transport to return home for Diwali. She not only handled for this trip but also for every other trip such as Onam and the unexpected long holiday at September end. When I had fever she accepted my call at the middle of the night and kept talking to me to help me feel better. No matter the trouble I am in she always helps me from wherever she is in whichever way she can.

I would also like to thank my father who despite his busy schedule makes some time everyday to talk to me and listen to me over the phone and help me with any problems or issues I have here. When I had some problems with my laptop, he made some time for me and helped me resolve the issue. When I had some difficulty in understanding a few things he patiently explained everything over the phone and taught me how to try and resolve these situations on my own here.

Both my parents have been a constant source of support to me.

Scenario 3:

Date: Everyday scenario

This is something that I notice every single day. 

The first one is about the cleaning and maintenance staff on campus. When I took a moment to reflect a few weeks back, I realised how much their efforts contribute to our comfort and well-being.

Every morning, when I enter the classroom, the board is clean, the floors are clean, and the corridors are neat and well-maintained. From my experience, I know how difficult it is to clean and maintain one single room neat everyday. These staff members work tirelessly, many a times starting their day early and finishing late, ensuring that our surroundings remain clean and hygienic.

Their dedication is something I deeply respect. Even on days when the weather is bad they clean and maintain the buildings. It's because of them that we get to enjoy a clean and fresh atmosphere inside the classrooms and buildings. 

I would also like to extend my gratitude towards all the professors. They patiently explain all the doubts me and my friends have no matter how silly they are both in the lab and theory classes.
