1.My friend harshitha who saved my day

One week before, I was rushing to college because I was getting late, and everyone was supposed to carry their ID cards for classes. As soon as I reached the college block, I realized something that  I had forgotten my ID card in my room.I stood there for a few seconds, completely shocked and worried. I didn’t know what to do. My hostel was far away, and going back meant losing too much time.
Just then, my phone rang — it was my friend. She said she saw my ID card lying near my books in our room. Without even thinking twice, she quickly decided to bring it all the way to college just for me. I waited nervously at the gate, hoping she would reach soon. When I finally saw her coming with a smile, holding my ID card in her hand, I felt such huge relief and happiness.
She handed it to me, saying, “Here, don’t worry! I knew you’d need it.” That small act of kindness touched my heart deeply. Because of her, I could attend the classes without any trouble. It reminded me that true friendship isn’t just about spending time together, but about being there for each other when it really matters.Sometimes, even small acts of kindness can make a big difference. True friends don’t just talk they show their care through their actions. I learned that being thankful for such people makes life more meaningful and beautiful.
I'm grateful for my caring friend who helped me when i needed it most.

2. When i got my bag back

One month back, In the afternoon, I went to Vaishnavi ma’am’s cabin to discuss some important details about my project. The discussion went well, and we spent a lot of time talking about ideas and improvements. When I finally stepped out of her cabin, it was already late in the evening, and most of my friends had left. As I walked toward my classroom, I realized something that made my heart skip a beat the classroom door was locked, and my bag was still inside! My books, notes, and even my wallet were in that bag. I was worried because I needed my notes for the next day’s class. I didn’t know what to do at that moment. While I stood there thinking, I saw Saurabh sir walking , probably heading back to home after a long day. Gathering some courage, I quickly went to him and explained my situation. Even though he was about to leave, he patiently listened to me and said calmly, “Don’t worry, just go and ask maintenance staff for the keys.”His words gave me hope. I immediately went back to maintenance staff member and told her what happened. Without any hesitation, she smiled kindly and handed me the key to the classroom. That simple act of trust and understanding truly touched my heart.
I rushed to the classroom, opened the door, and finally saw my bag lying on the bench. The moment I picked it up, I felt such a deep sense of relief and gratitude. What seemed like a small problem at first had turned into a big lesson about kindness, patience, and the goodness of people around me.Sometimes, even when we feel stuck or helpless, there are always people who are willing to help if we simply ask politely and honestly. I realized that showing respect and gratitude makes our college environment warmer and more supportive. I'm grateful to Saurabh sir, and the maintenance staff who helped when i was new to this campus and i learnt that when we are honest and ask for help politely, there are always kind people ready to help us.

3. A Kind Bus Driver

This afternoon taught me a small but beautiful lesson about kindness. After lunch, I realized I was running late for my next class. I quickly packed my things and rushed out, hoping to catch the college bus in time. As I reached the bus stop, I saw the bus just starting to move. M I began running as fast as I could, and I kept hoping the driver would notice me. To my surprise, he did. The bus driver saw me running from a distance and, instead of continuing, he slowed down and waited patiently until I reached. I finally climbed in, out of breath but smiling with relief. I quickly said, “Thank you, uncle,” and he replied with a kind smile, “Be careful next time.” His calm tone and understanding nature touched my heart. It may seem like a small thing, but to me, it meant a lot. If he hadn’t waited, I would have missed the bus, reached class late, and maybe even got marked absent. Because of his patience and kindness, my day went smoothly and my mood completely changed. Sometimes, kindness doesn’t need big actions or words — even waiting for someone can show care and humanity. That moment reminded me that goodness still exists everywhere, even in simple, everyday interactions.
I’m grateful for the bus driver’s patience and understanding.
