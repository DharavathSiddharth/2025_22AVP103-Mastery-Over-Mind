# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
3 instances of people helping me in Amrita:

1. Last month, I experience something that reminded me how small acts of kindness can mean so much. It was a typical afternoon, and I was a bit late catching the hostel shuttle after lunch. I didn't worry about missing the bus this time, but this time, I thought I’d just have to wait for the next one or find a different way. But then, something kind happened. The driver was still there, waiting. And not just waiting in that mechanical, “I have to wait for the schedule” kind of way, but genuinely patient. Even though I was the only person on the bus and my stop wasn’t even the next one, he asked where I wanted to go and started the bus without a second thought. It was like he had all the time in the world for me, even though I knew he didn’t. That small choice of waiting just a little longer and driving me to my stop was a kindness that changed whole day. It reminded me how easy it is to b rude to peple and how nice it can be when someone chooses to be kind. He didn't have to wait or ask or take me all the way but he did, and that meant a lot. It wasn’t just about catching the bus or not being late anymore. That moment made me think about how much we all rush through life, often too busy to slow down and care about the small interactions that really matter. It made me want to be that driver, the kind of person who looks up from their day’s to do list and says, “Hey, I’ve got a moment. Let me make this easier for someone.” I walked away with this feeling of gratitude, but also little bit of motivation. How often do I get caught up in my own busy life and forget that a bit of patience or kindness could make someone’s day? That bus ride reminded me that kindness doesn’t have to be, it can be as simple as waiting a minute longer or asking a question with genuine care. Reflecting on it now, I realize moments like these are what connect us, in this busy world. A small kindness froma strangerchanged my day. It made me appreciate how we all have our own challenges, and sometimes, all it takes is a little extra care to make things better. I’m grateful to that driver , not just because he waited for me, but because his simple kindness helped me see the beauty in those everyday moments. And it’s a reminder I’ll carry always with me, that being kind, even in a little ways, is always worth it.

2.When I think back to my very first week at Amrita, what stands out isn’t the mess food. It’s the feeling of being almost swallowed up by the huge campus. Every building seemed the same, and I dont understand directions. I must’ve looked really lost, maybe just another nervous first year though I tried to blend in. The oddest thing about being lost that week wasn’t wandering from block to block or staring at maps; it was this weird hesitance to reach out for help. Somehow, the seniors roaming the corridors seemed out of reach, Even though I could've asked I kept quiet, hoping it would work out. But then, while standing around unsure of where to go next, someone reached out to me before I even asked for help. A senior, probably busy with her own plans, stopped and gave me a friendly, familiar smile. She didn’t wait for me to say a ything, she just started guiding, asking about my classes and showing some shortcuts. I didn'tsay anything. Her way of talking melted away some anxiety. That moment is one of the best memories from my first week. She didn’t just show me where a classroom was, she made Amrita feel less like a maze and more like a place where I belong. Every once in a while, I think about how nervous I was before she helped me out, and how better I felt after. There’s something comforting in knowing that the people around you can be kind, even when you don't ask them to be. Looking back, I’m honestly grateful things worked out that way. Meeting someone who went out of her way to make a random girl feel at home changed my view on starting out in a new place. It’s these brief moments, the ones that seem small to others, that keep reminding me how happy. If every week could start out with kindness like that, I think settling in anywhere would be a lot easier. So as complicated as Amrita’s campus still sometimes feels, little gestures like hers make me ralize that I’m not just here to study, I’m here to find other people. 

3. Back in August, when I fell really sick, I don’t think I could have asked for better support than what I got from my roommates. Being unwell in a new place felt sad, especially when you’re tired. But they made sure I never felt like I was going through it alone. They didn’t just check in occasionally,they took care of me like family.It wasn’t just bringing me food or medicine, it was the little things that really touched me. They made sure I stayed hydrated, reminding me gently to drink water even when I felt too weak to bother. When I was struggling to keep my energy up, one of them made soup without me even having to ask They also tidied up my space and kept things quiet around me so I could rest. Honestly, what struck me most was how natural their care felt. It wasn’t forced, it was just genuine kindness. Every time they checked on me or quietly left a glass of water by my bed, it reminded me how lucky I am to live with people who actually care. That experience gave me a appreciation for the idea of home, with the people who make it feel safe and comforting. I’ll always carry those small acts of thoughtfulness with me, because they made what could have been a lonely time into something I could get through with hope. Now that I’m better, I’m feeling really thankful for my roommates,not just for what they did when I was sick, but for being genuinely kind people. It’s made me realize how important it is to appreciate those who show up for you every day. I’m lucky, and I won’t forget it.
