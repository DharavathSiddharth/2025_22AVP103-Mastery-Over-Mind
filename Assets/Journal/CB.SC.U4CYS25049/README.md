# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind

Scenario 1: When Mahiesh Helped Me Through the Chaos
Date: September 14th, 2025

September 14th was one of those days where everything came at me at once. Four assignments, a presentation, and a group project all piled up together. I was already low on sleep, skipping meals, and honestly just mentally drained. I went to the AB2 library around noon and just sat there staring at my laptop. I wasn’t studying. My mind felt blank.

I called Mahiesh. He came within minutes, pulled a chair next to me and said, “You look stressed.” And I don’t know why, but hearing that made everything I was holding inside just come out. I told him about the algorithm assignment, the Linear Algebra questions, the Burp Suite task, the P-SAT presentation where I had to speak (which I was really scared about), and our group project. I told him how tired I was and how I felt like I couldn’t handle it anymore.

He listened. That’s it. He didn’t interrupt, didn’t tell me I was overreacting. He just listened properly. After I finished, he reminded me about how I handled my 12th board exams — how much pressure I went through back then and still managed. He said, “If you survived that, you can handle this. You already proved you can.”

That hit me. He didn’t solve my problems, but he reminded me of my own strength. And honestly, that is what I needed at that moment.

We sat there for a while. Then I slowly started working again. I didn’t magically finish everything easily, but the weight felt lighter. I submitted all the work in time — maybe not perfect — but done. And that felt like a win.

What I realized that day is that friendship isn’t always about being funny or hanging out. Sometimes it’s just someone sitting beside you when your mind is collapsing. I’m really grateful for that. For him being there, without making a scene, without trying to “fix me,” just being present.

Scenario 2
Adhi’s Patient Teaching Changed Everything
Date: September 10th–15th, 2025

Between September 10th and 15th, I was really struggling with Linear Algebra. Not just “I need to study more” struggling — I genuinely didn’t understand the concepts. Row space, column space, null space… I would look at the textbook and nothing was making sense. I felt frustrated and honestly a bit stupid.

In class, when Zellam ma’am explained things, I couldn’t follow. I don’t know if it was the speed, the style, or maybe I just wasn’t getting the basics. I was nodding like I understood, but inside I was blank. I could do steps by memorizing, but I didn’t understand the meaning behind them, and that made me more stressed.

I asked a couple of classmates for help earlier, but their explanations were too advanced for me at that time. So after the second test went badly, I finally asked Adhi, who sits next to me. He said “Okay, I’ll teach you,” without hesitation.

We studied in the classroom and library. And what made the difference was his patience. He didn’t assume I knew anything. He explained things slowly, from the basics, using simple notes and small diagrams. He explained row space like directions you can create from the row vectors. Suddenly, I could picture it. When he explained null space, he said, “These are the inputs that make the output zero.” It finally clicked.

He didn’t get irritated if I didn’t understand something. He just explained again differently. That mattered a lot.

Before this, Adhi was just the quiet topper guy who sat next to me. After studying together, I saw his nature — calm, helpful, no ego. I think he helped me just because I genuinely needed help, and he could give it.

In the next assessment, I felt more confident. I understood what I was doing, not just copying steps. Even if I didn’t score full marks, I knew I improved.

I am genuinely grateful to Adhi. He didn’t just help me pass; he helped me actually understand. And that changed my confidence, not just my notes.

Scenario 3 
Mr. Sibi’s Guidance During SIH Confusion
Date: September 14th, 2025

On the same stressful week, our SIH (Smart India Hackathon) problem statement also became a mess. Our team Hustle Squad (me, Mahiesh, Vishaak, Shivani, Adhi, and Sanjai) had already chosen a problem and started collecting work. I thought we were prepared.

Then our mentor, Mr. Sibi, told us the problem we selected was too complicated for first-year students. When he said we should change it, I felt panic. We had already invested time, and I was scared the team would blame me since I was the leader.

But instead of leaving us confused, he sat with us. He explained why the old problem wasn’t suitable — too many dependencies, not practical for our level, and hard to complete in time. Then he walked us through new problem statements and helped us evaluate them properly — something no one had done for us earlier.

The way he spoke was calm. There was no judgment. He didn’t say we were wrong — he guided us to understand what made sense. That made me feel supported, not scolded.

We finally selected a cybersecurity-related problem that matched our skills. And honestly, that decision saved us from struggling later. If he didn’t step in at the right time, we would have been stuck.

That day I understood what a mentor actually is — not someone who just teaches topics, but someone who makes sure you move in the right direction. I’m really grateful Sibi sir cared enough to guide us instead of just letting us crash..
