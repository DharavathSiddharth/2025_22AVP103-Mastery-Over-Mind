# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
Scenario 1

A few weeks ago, our college changed the transport system a bit. Since not many students were using the P.N. Pudur and Vadavalli buses, the college put both routes together. This meant students from both areas had to travel together. They chose the Vadavalli bus for everyone and gave us set seats to make things easier.

At first, things went well. Everyone had their own seat, and we got used to having more people on the bus. But one day, on the way home, we saw that some students were sitting in our assigned seats. For a moment, we weren’t sure what to do.

The bus was pretty full, and everyone just wanted to sit down after a long day. I’m not the type to walk up to people and ask them to move, so I just stood there, not sure what to do. A few of us glanced at each other, but nobody said anything. It was a bit awkward because we didn’t want to seem rude or start any arguments about the seats.

Just when things started to feel a bit uncomfortable, a senior from our bus stepped in to help. She’s an M.Tech student and travels with us often. She calmly walked up to the group sitting in our seats and explained that those spots were actually meant for Vadavalli students. She spoke politely and didn’t blame anyone. She even helped the others find different seats so that everyone could settle down.

I was relieved she took charge. Without her, it could have become confusing. As our teacher-in-charge wasn’t there, she made sure everyone had a place to sit and no one was left out.

What impressed me was how easily she handled it. She didn’t look stressed or annoyed; she just managed everything calmly and practically. Watching her, I realized that some people know how to step up without making things awkward for others.

Once everything was sorted, the bus ride went on as usual. The students who had taken our seats moved without any fuss, and the mood lightened up. People started chatting again, and the journey was smooth.

I was especially thankful she stepped in. For someone like me who finds it hard to talk to strangers, her quick action kept things under control and made a difference.

Later, I made it a point to thank her personally when we got off the bus. She simply smiled and said it was nothing, but I genuinely appreciated her help. It reminded me how small acts of initiative can make things easier for everyone.

After that day, I also noticed how organized our bus travel continued to be. Even though two routes were merged, students began cooperating more effectively. Everyone began to follow the seat arrangement more strictly, and there were no further confusions. It felt good to see that a small misunderstanding was sorted out so quickly and didn’t turn into an argument.

In general, that day demonstrated to me the effectiveness of calm communication. Many times, situations become tense not because of what happens, but because of how people react to them. If someone had responded impatiently or argued, it could have created unnecessary tension. But because she handled it maturely and politely, everything went smoothly.

Personally, I was also glad that I didn’t have to get into a conversation that I might have found awkward. It’s not that I don’t speak up when needed, but in situations like these, I tend to hesitate. Watching how she spoke—clear, polite, and confident—was something I admired.

Since that day, our combined bus rides have been running much more efficiently. The same senior often helps with seating arrangements when the teacher-in-charge isn’t around, and she does it without making it seem like a big task. It’s nice to have someone like that who takes initiative naturally.

I was genuinely thankful that she took the effort to handle the situation in such a smooth way. Her quick response helped avoid what could have turned into a lot of unnecessary confusion or discomfort. It also made the rest of us feel more comfortable and less awkward during the journey.

Looking back, the incident was simple but quite telling. It showed how much difference one person’s small action can make in maintaining order and peace in a group setting. It also reminded me that sometimes stepping up doesn’t require a big effort—just clarity and the willingness to help others.

Overall, I was grateful that everything got sorted out without any conflict. The M.Tech student’s polite approach, the cooperation from the others, and the general understanding among the passengers made the whole experience smooth. It’s these small, day-to-day moments that make shared spaces more manageable and pleasant.

After that day, I felt a bit more confident that even if a similar situation happened again, I’d be able to handle it more calmly. It was a simple incident, but one that left a positive impression on me. It made me appreciate the importance of handling small problems quietly and effectively.

So, while this may not seem like a very significant event, it did leave me with a sense of gratitude. I was thankful that the misunderstanding didn’t turn into an argument, thankful that someone stepped up to help, and thankful that our journey could continue peacefully.

That’s really all that happened — nothing dramatic, but it’s one of those small everyday situations where you realize that a bit of patience and helpfulness can make a big difference in how smoothly things go.



Scenario 2

Last month, just before our mid-semester exams, our college released the examination schedule. Initially, an older version of the timetable was shared, but a few days later, a revised schedule was issued. The revised one had a few changes — some exams were postponed, others were rescheduled, and the shift timings were also slightly adjusted. Everything seemed clear, but I didn’t realize at the time how easy it was to get confused between the two versions.

The week before the exams was quite hectic. There were multiple submissions, revisions, and last-minute study sessions happening all around. Like most students, I downloaded both versions of the timetable when they were released, but unfortunately, I didn’t pay close attention to which one was the updated one. I had both saved in the same folder, and they looked almost identical, except for the minor date changes.

On the day before one of my exams, I was calmly preparing at home, following what I thought was the correct schedule. According to the old timetable, my exam was supposed to be the next afternoon, so I planned my study pace accordingly. I was in the middle of revising a few topics when I suddenly got a call from my friend. She sounded a bit surprised and asked, “Aren’t you coming for the exam?”

For a second, I didn’t understand what she meant. I told her that the exam was scheduled for the next day. That’s when she clarified that, according to the revised timetable, the exam had been postponed by one day and that the afternoon session was happening that very day.

I felt a sudden wave of panic when I realized what had happened. I immediately opened my phone, checked the messages again, and sure enough — there were two timetables. The one I had been referring to was the old version. The new version clearly mentioned that the exam was scheduled for that day.

Thankfully, I had the afternoon shift, which meant I still had a few hours before the paper started. If the shift had been in the morning, I probably would have missed it entirely. I quickly gathered my things, reviewed whatever I could in the limited time, and rushed to get ready. I managed to reach the campus just in time before the exam began.

Looking back, I realized how close I was to missing that paper completely, all because of a small oversight. It was a simple mistake — just checking the wrong file — but it could have had serious consequences if my friend hadn’t called me. I was honestly very thankful to her for taking the time to check on me and confirm. It’s not something everyone would think to do, especially right before their own exam, when everyone is usually busy and stressed.

That quick phone call saved me a lot of trouble. I was also glad that the exam shift was in the afternoon because that gave me enough time to get to college and settle down without rushing too much. I reached about 20 minutes before the reporting time, which was enough to catch my breath and quickly go through a few notes.

The exam itself went fine, but the incident made me much more cautious about verifying official updates. After that day, I made it a habit to always double-check any revised circular or timetable. I also started deleting old versions immediately to avoid confusion in the future. It was a small learning experience that taught me how easily a small mix-up can happen if you’re not careful.

I also felt genuinely grateful to have friends who look out for each other like that. In busy times like exams, everyone tends to be caught up in their own preparation, so the fact that she remembered to call and check made a big difference. It was such a simple gesture, but it really mattered that day.

After the exams ended, when we were talking about it later, we all laughed about the incident. Apparently, I wasn’t the only one who had almost made the same mistake. A couple of other classmates had also mixed up the timetables initially, but they had realized it earlier. It made me feel slightly better knowing that I wasn’t the only one who got confused.

Overall, I was just thankful that things worked out fine in the end. It was one of those small moments that could have easily gone wrong, but thanks to a bit of luck and timely help from a friend, it didn’t.

It also reminded me that small habits like keeping track of updated information can make a big difference during busy times. Now, whenever there’s a new circular or message from the department, I make sure to check the date, version, and any small notes carefully.

That incident also made me appreciate the importance of staying calm when something unexpected happens. For a few minutes, when I realized I had been following the wrong timetable, I was completely flustered. But once I figured out that I still had time to make it, I decided not to waste energy panicking and instead focused on getting ready quickly. Staying composed helped me think clearly and manage everything in time.

In the end, the day turned out fine. I made it to the exam, wrote it without any major issues, and came back home feeling both relieved and slightly amused at how close I had come to missing it. The next time any revised timetable came out, I made sure to share it in the class group chat myself — partly to remind others, and partly to remind myself not to repeat that mistake.

It was a small but memorable experience that reminded me to stay alert and double-check information, especially during exam time. Most importantly, it showed how a small act of concern from a friend can make a big difference when you least expect it.



Scenario 3

A few months ago, during one of our regular lab sessions, we faced an unexpected issue with the electrical outlets in our classroom. One whole column of benches suddenly lost power — the sockets stopped working completely. Since most of our lab work depends on laptops and we need them plugged in throughout the session, this created quite a bit of inconvenience.

Initially, we thought it might be a temporary issue, maybe a tripped switch or a loose connection, so a few of us tried unplugging and replugging the chargers. But it soon became clear that the outlets themselves were not working at all. Only one socket near the main switchboard was functional.

That evening was especially busy because we had an assignment due soon. Since only one outlet was working, everyone had to take turns charging their laptops. We tried managing by keeping the chargers plugged in for a few minutes each and switching turns, but it didn’t work very well. It slowed us down, and many of us were worried about not being able to finish our work before the deadline.

Instead of just complaining among ourselves, we decided to inform the staff in charge right away. We explained the issue to the technical maintenance team and mentioned that it was affecting our work during lab sessions. They noted down the problem and assured us they would get it checked the next day.

Honestly, we weren’t sure how long it would take, but to our surprise, the issue was resolved by the next morning. When we came in for class, all the outlets were working again. The repair team had fixed the wiring overnight, and everything was back to normal. It was such a relief because our next lab session went smoothly without any interruptions.

I was genuinely grateful for how quickly the staff handled the situation. They could have easily postponed it or taken a few days, but instead, they prioritized it, knowing that it was affecting our academic work. It showed a level of efficiency and concern that we really appreciated.

After that, we also became more careful about reporting such issues promptly. Earlier, we might have ignored small technical problems, thinking they’d sort themselves out, but after this experience, we realized that proper communication with the concerned department helps things get done faster.

That small incident made me realize how important the support staff are in keeping things running smoothly behind the scenes. We often don’t notice their work unless something goes wrong, but they play a huge part in ensuring our classrooms and labs function properly.

Overall, it was a simple situation, but it reminded me how teamwork and timely response can make a big difference in day-to-day college life. The maintenance staff’s quick action really helped us stay on track with our coursework, and I was thankful that they resolved the problem so efficiently.
