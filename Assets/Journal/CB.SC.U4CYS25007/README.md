# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
date:11.11.2025
place : Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham

I am most grateful to all my faculties and friends. On not completing my schooling in a good mind state , at first i was not very much comfortable taking to people and socialising . But soon enough I got along with Pranay, Deva, Anushree,Siddarth and Rohit .
The memory of those first weeks at college is still crisp, yet mercifully distant. Straight out of schooling and without a "good mind state," as I call it, I felt less like a new beginning and more like an anxious continuation. The most minor interactions felt like tasks. I didn’t just avoid talking to people, I actually prefered a physical boundary, finding comfort in the quiet crowded spaces where I could observe rather than participate. Socializing felt like unnatural and restrictive. In this background of discomfort, the transformation that of getting along and making sure to participate not only feels like a happy circumstance but also a genuine turning point, one for which I am eternally grateful to the people who helped me come out of my walls.

This change began, rather ironically, with an intense, goal-oriented project the SIH preparations. It’s funny how shared stress and mutual dependence can forge the strongest bonds. This hackathon that introduced me to Pranay, Deva, Anushree, Siddharth, and Rohit who were a part of my SIH team. Looking back, I realize they didn’t just accept me , they made me comfortable , not through grand gestures, but through steady, consistent presence.
Pranay and deva both had a natural air of leadership, listened to everyone, even the quietest members.They  generally possess that rare ability to manage complex logistics while maintaining an easy-going mindset; in this sense, they keep the whole group focused but never stressed . Rohit, Anushree, and Siddharth each played a crucial part in breaking down the  walls I had put up. When, for days initially, I'd sit silent, trying to make sense of what we were doing and how we were gooing to accomplish the task, one of them would turn around and ask a keen, specific question about the task, dragging me into the discussion on the work. This was necessary, it normalized my presence through shared mission .We spent countless hours working together, we planned our approach, debated solutions, and-most importantly learned. For all of us, the learning was new, but the pressure turned eventually because we faced it as a groupp. Every small victory in our planning, every late-night talk were we spent more time on dreaming the day we would strike than the actual preparation, was a memory held in common. In deep collaboration, this process strengthened our bond not only as team members but also as people who had seen each other under pressure and emerged better form it , more likely a small comfort circle were anyone can share anything without hesitation and count on the people to have my back. 
The gratitude I feel for this beginning is profound. They didn't make me change; they merely provided space where it was safe to be myself, where my skills were valued, and my presence was appreciated. The SIH preparations were the catalyst, but the inbuilt kindness within them was the foundation my comfort was rebuilt on. They turned a potentially solitary first year into one worth living through!

The SIH preparation was the one that forged our bond, then our daily rituals , dependable moments , the daily tea break, the shared lunch, and the free hours which we mostly spend playin cards or dumbcharads are the actual pillars of our friendship and a source of immense, daily gratitude.The daily tea break has evolved into a sacred time. It’s a deliberate pause in our often tight schedule . Stepping away from the classroom, the notes, and the lecture halls, and gathering at the usual spot with a cup of tea is a must. the conversations and energies shift seamlessly. The quiet reassurance of seeing five familiar, friendly faces waiting for that break is often the motivation that gets me through a tough morning. It is a commitment , a daily, unspoken promise to prioritize connection over commitment. 

My gratitude extends beyond the immediate circle to the support and mentorship we received from our SIH mentor, Vaishnavi Ma'am. Being a first-year student, tackling such a high-stake, competitive event as the SIH was truly overwhelming. The technical requirements were intimidating, and structuring a complex project from scratch was uncharted territory. She was a mentor rather than a supervisor. She understood that we were freshers , not only in the project but also in the college environment. She was one of the few individuals who combined deep technical knowledge with patience. When we would get lost in a forest of documentation or be in a conflict between theoretical concepts and practical implementation, she never gave away the answer but walked us back to the fundamental principle. "Understanding the 'why' is more important than implementing the 'how' right now," she would often say, shifting our attention from frantic execution to deliberate learning. What I value most, however, is that her guidance ranged far beyond the technical scope of the project. It was my first year, and not only was I struggling with time , but I was also battling this huge shift in academic culture. she understood this subtle stress. She taught us to approach deadlines not as insurmountable obstacles but as milestones and to treat failures not as some sort of definitive ending but as rich data points for iteration. Her confidence in our team, even when we felt really shaky, became our own. When we would present ideas that were a little off-kilter, she would gently pivot them toward feasibility, always framing her suggestions as an enhancement rather than a correction.
The mentorship she provided was fundamentally about empowerment. She taught us the process of self-learning and encouraged us to rely on our collective problem-solving skills before seeking external help. She trusted us, and that trust was the fuel that made us work harder and smarter. Knowing that we had a mentor who was truly invested in our development—not just our results—created a psychological safety net. This safety net allowed us to experiment fearlessly, voice our tentative ideas without fear of judgment, and critically manage the high pressure of SIH with composure.
It is a foundation she helped us build in that very first project that will define my academic trajectory. Not only did she guide us through SIH, but she also taught me how to be a better learner, a better teammate, and a more resilient person. I'm deeply grateful for such an investment of time, knowledge, and faith.  Balance, Growth, and Future Intent Looking at the impact all together of my friends and my mentor, I see a beautiful tapestry made out of shared efforts, laughter, and wisdom. It has been a balancing year this year. With a group as cohesive and fun as this, it would be easy to get completely swept away by the socializing, including tea, lunch, and plays. However, the deeper bond we share is mutual respect for each other's ambitions and futures. This is why we consciously make time to study. The study sessions are often just as collaborative as the SIH preparations. We don't just sit in silence; we quiz each other, explain concepts using analogies, and collectively break down the week’s curriculum. This intentional commitment to academic performance proves that our friendship is not a distraction, but an enhancement. They make studying less isolating and infinitely more effective. Pranay, probably employing those leadership skills, often initiates the serious academic block, ensuring that the fun serves as a reward rather than an avoidance tactic. The knowledge that they value success and self-improvement as much as companionship is the final ingredient in my immense gratitude for this peer group. The most important growth, though, is personal and emotional. The self that entered college—uncomfortable, hesitant, and quiet—was given the right tools and a safe space to grow into someone more engaged, confident, and joyous. This group-Pranay, Deva, Anushree, Siddharth, and Rohit-did not become just my friends; they became my anchor. They helped me realize that vulnerability is not a weakness, but a prerequisite for connection. Their steadfast presence, coupled with Vaishnavi Ma'am's purposeful, empowering guidance, has fundamentally changed the trajectory of my life in this institution. My intention going forward is to return and pay forward this gift of friendship. I pledge to be that same sure, encouraging, and giving friend they have been to me. I want to keep fostering these rituals—of bringing lunch along, insisting on the daily tea break, and making time for play—because I now understand that it is these little things that are, in fact, the biggest investments we will ever make in our well-being. I intend to honor the mentorship of Vaishnavi Ma'am by continuing to learn diligently and approaching every new project with the same curiosity and resilience she instilled in us. I am grateful for the foundation of trust, the abundance of laughter, the commitment to learning, and the profound sense of belonging that they have all given me. Much more than a journal entry, this is a promise to hold close and maintain the greatest gift of this year-a truly remarkable network of friends and mentors.
I am also greatfull to our math sir , Mr. Sreenivasan sir. He makes sure each and everyone in the class understands the concepts and has created a friendly environment where we could interact an learn easily!
