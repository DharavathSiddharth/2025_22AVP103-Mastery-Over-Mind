Thanks to My Indian Heritage Teacher, Mr. Karthik Sharma

I really want to thank my Indian Heritage teacher, Mr. Karthik Sharma, for all the knowledge and help he’s given us. When I first walked into his class, I thought we’d just be memorizing a bunch of stuff. But he showed us right away that our heritage isn't just something to study for a test – it’s part of who we are.
He helped me see that our heritage isn't some old thing from the past. It still shapes who we are today. What’s so cool about Mr. Sharma is how much he cares and how clear he is when he teaches. He doesn't just rush to finish things. He ties everything back to real life. When he talks about festivals, he asks us about how our families get ready and what those times mean to us. When he explains art or traditions, he tells us stories about the people who made them – what they went through, how hard they worked, and how they felt. He taught us that our culture isn't just something to study. It is a part of life.
One thing I’ll always remember from his class was our cultural project. At first, a lot of us didn't know where to start or if our traditions were good enough. But Mr. Sharma told us to start with our families – to talk to our parents and grandparents, watch what they do every day, and just pay attention to the small things: meals together, blessings, getting ready for holidays. He helped us realize that our heritage isn't just in old buildings or famous customs. It’s in our stories, habits, and everyday lives. Because of him, the project felt really personal. We felt so much for our roots.
Mr. Sharma explains things so well. Indian heritage is a big topic. It includes history, culture, religion, and art. But he makes it easy to understand without losing what makes it feel meaningful. He uses examples from daily life to help us get it. We don’t just memorize things. We *get* things and remember them His way of teaching changes how we see the world.
I really like how patient he is. In his class, you can always ask questions. Even if you ask the same thing a bunch of times, he listens and explains it until you get it. He never makes you feel dumb for not knowing something. Because of that, the class feels open and safe. We aren’t just listening to a teacher. We're actually learning.
Mr. Sharma also reminds us that our heritage includes things like respect and being kind. He always says that traditions stick around because they have good advice that we can use today. You don’t see that in the syllabus, but it’s one of the most important things we’ll ever learn.
You can really see how much he cares about his class. He puts so much thinking into it. You can see meaningful to topics we learned about such as books and stories to art, music, and daily life. He's changed how I see the world. He's taught me to find meaning even in the small things.
He’s also kind outside of class. He helps us during cultural events. If a student has a problem, he listens and gives good advice. You can tell he really cares about us. He teaches because he wants us to grow and do well.
I've learned so much from him. His teaching has made me feel closer to my family’s traditions. I now understand why certain things matter and how the stories we hear teach us things. Culture is something you need to respect, live and carry on.
Mr. Sharma taught us that heritage isn't about being stuck in the past. It’s about knowing where you come from so you can go forward with confidence. You can respect your roots and still grow.
I’m really thankful to Mr. Karthik Sharma for his patience and kindness. His lessons will stay with me. I’ll always remember his teachings as I grow up.

Hello Hostel Cleaners,

I want to say a big thank you to all of you who keep our hostel clean. Most of us don't really think about it, but you make a big difference in our daily lives. You're the ones who make our rooms neat and the hallways tidy. You're here early in the morning or late at night, and you don't always get the credit you deserve. But here at our hostel, we see you for the great people you are. You might not be loud, but your work is super key to making us feel comfy and good.
Sometimes the hostel is crazy – everyone's rushing around, rooms are messy, and common areas are packed. But no matter how wild things get, you always bring things back to normal. Thanks to you, our hostel always feels welcoming and chill. The little stuff you do, like the fresh smell after cleaning, the neat spaces, and the clean floors, changes how we feel, our health, and our peace of mind. Most people might not notice it every day, but we all live better because of you.
I especially remember during event week. The hostel was full of junk. Everyone was busy and tired. But you kept doing your thing with patience, never complaining about the extra mess. You just did what had to be done, and that showed us that real work isn't about getting attention – it's about caring and being consistent.
Your work also teaches us something about respect. A lot of times, society forgets about the people who clean. But no place – home, school, or even the world – can work without cleanliness. It's what makes health, order, and peace possible. Cleaning isn't just physical work; it's caring for others. You show that every day with your hard work.
They say, Cleanliness is next to godliness. It's not just about clean rooms – it also helps us think clearly. A clean place helps us relax and live healthy. You make that space for us. You make it easy for us to study, chill, and feel at home. You help make our hostel better and make everyone happier.
When we talk about making the world better, we think of big stuff. But real change starts small – with one room or one person who cares. You show us that caring for our space doesn't need to be anything big. It starts with being responsible and patient. You make the world better with the small details.
Your job also takes a lot of strength. Sweeping, lifting, bending – it's tiring and it takes energy. But you do it every day, often with a smile. We respect that lot. A lot of us can't stay consistent when we're tired, but you show us what real commitment looks like.
Besides working hard, you're also kind. You greet students, speak carefully, and treat the hostel like it's your own. That makes us feel good. It shows that real service comes from the heart. You teach us that no work is too small and everyone matters. A hostel can't work without the people who keep it clean. Cleanliness is the basis for comfort, health, and happiness.
A lot of people want to be famous, but you show the power of hard work. You're not just taking care of a building; you're making a place where students can live, learn, and grow.
Thanks for your patience, hard work, and kindness. You change our daily lives more than we can say. You teach us to be respectful and responsible. Please know that we see and value your work, not just what you do, but how you do it.
Thanks for making our hostel a better place to live.

Gratitude to Our Respected Class Advisor, Mr. Praveen

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Mr. Praveen, our class advisor, whose guidance, patience, and steady support have shaped not only our academic experience but also our growth as individuals. Being a class advisor is not easy—you balance responsibilities, student concerns, and countless challenges every day. Yet through it all, your presence has remained calm, reassuring, and dependable. Whenever we needed direction, motivation, or simply someone to understand us, you were always there.
Your support was especially meaningful during our exam periods. At a time when stress, anxiety, and self-doubt were high, you reminded us that exams are not just about marks—they are about learning with clarity, practicing steadily, and trusting ourselves. You helped us stay grounded and focused rather than overwhelmed. Instead of telling us to simply “study harder,” you guided us to study smarter—with consistency, understanding, and calmness. You showed us that confidence matters more than comparison and that true preparation comes from patience and sincerity, not panic. Because of you, many of us faced our exams with courage and balance instead of fear.
Your support extended far beyond academics. In a class filled with different personalities and opinions, misunderstandings are bound to happen. Yet, whenever conflicts arose, you handled them with fairness and patience. You gave every student a chance to speak openly without judgment. You never took sides; you guided us toward respectful solutions that valued everyone’s feelings. Through this, you taught us that a class is not just a group of individuals—it’s a community built on cooperation and mutual respect. We learned to communicate honestly, listen better, and see situations from more than one perspective. These lessons in maturity and empathy will stay with us long after we leave the classroom.
Your role was also vital when it came to handling faculty-related issues. These situations can be sensitive and confusing for students, but you created a safe and respectful space for us to express ourselves. You listened with empathy, understood both sides, and communicated thoughtfully with the concerned teachers. You made sure our voices were heard while maintaining harmony and respect. Through your maturity and emotional intelligence, you became a bridge between students and faculty—a bridge built on trust and understanding. Because of you, issues were resolved peacefully, and our class became a more united and confident group.
Beyond these moments, your daily interactions with us have had a quiet yet powerful impact. Your tone is always calm, your expectations fair, and your guidance firm yet kind. You teach discipline not through fear but through understanding. You encourage responsibility without pressure. You inspire us to do our best—not to compete with others, but to respect our own potential. Through your guidance, we learned that our attitude, behavior, and decisions shape who we become.
Your influence extends well beyond academics. You have taught us how to think clearly, solve problems wisely, and remain patient even when life feels difficult. You have shown that leadership does not need to be loud to be strong, and that true teaching is not limited to lessons—it builds character. You’ve reminded us that success is not just about achievements, but also about integrity, balance, and compassion.
There are teachers who take classes, and there are teachers who build lives. Mr. Praveen, you have done both. Your guidance has helped us study better, communicate better, and understand ourselves better. Your patience has taught us maturity; your fairness has taught us respect; and your belief in us has taught us confidence.
We may not say it every day, but we deeply appreciate the time, care, and thought you invest in us. We notice your sincerity and the calm way you handle every situation—whether it’s an academic concern, a class misunderstanding, or a personal struggle. You have stood by us not just as a teacher, but as a mentor and supporter.
For your encouragement during exams, your fairness in handling class issues, your understanding in resolving concerns, and your steady faith in our potential—we are truly grateful. Your influence will continue far beyond this year, shaping how we think, act, and move forward in life.
Thank you, Mr. Praveen, for being a guide we could always count on—for your patience, kindness, and wisdom. You have been a constant source of strength and inspiration, and your impact will stay with us for years to come.
