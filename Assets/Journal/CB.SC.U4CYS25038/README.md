# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
In this Amrita university I am grateful for some people 
In those people these three are main scenarios where iam grateful.


1.  I dont know the exact date, but around 15-20 September. I met this guy named sridhar  who is from the same section which I belong to. One fine day when i  had  no bag or books with me because i didnt knew that there were further classes that afternoon. So that i came to the class without books, pen and my bag.  There were classes that day also sir asked to check notes even though he didnt know me he helped me with a book and a pen even though he didnt had a pen so that iam grateful for him.                           

2. Iam grateful for our class advisors because everyone in our class had a problem with PSAT . Anyone dont know how to approach them and how to adress the issue . At that particular time they called out for a class meeting which helped us discuss the issue with them and move that problem forward so this is after the mid term exams likely around middle of the october

3. Iam grateful for my roommates because at the the time when i entered the college i didnt knew a single person in the college and my birthday also was too near . I was worrying that i was gonna celebrate this birthday alone but they however knew that my birthday was on the 16th of august and celebrated it as it was their best friends birthday so that iam grateful for them .
