# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind



## Journal Record
Scenario-1 

I want to show my gratitude to our beloved Saurabh sir. On the first day, I felt very nervous, like Why did I choose the Cybersecurity field at this university It was like stepping into a world where everything felt foreign, and the feeling of being deprived of my family can't be expressed in words. The first few hours of the day were filled with a whirlwind of emotions, from excitement to fear, from anticipation to deep loneliness. I felt like a stranger not only in this new institute but also in my own life. I had always believed that I was emotionally strong, independent, and adaptable. But stepping into that classroom on the first day of my Cybersecurity course made me realise that being away from home was a much bigger emotional challenge than I had anticipated. Everybody around me looked confident, busy chatting with their new peers, while I silently sat and wished for something to hold on to that was familiar.
 At the time of the cybersecurity essentials period, I saw a person enter the class. I didn't realise that our Saurabh sir is the one who is gonna be taking the Cybersecurity Essentials class. I remember how casually he walked into the room, carrying an aura of calm and assurance with him, and then he introduced himself. The way he spoke immediately captured my attention, and the first question he asked was, "How many of you choose this field willingly on your own?" That single question struck me deep. It wasn't an academic query; it was deeply human. That one question, though simple, connected all of us in an instant. It created a silent bond of shared vulnerability within the class. This made me realise that I amn't the only person to feel this way. He taught us about how life in this college would go, especially in a demanding technical field like Cybersecurity, which might be hard to get through initially. 
He told us it was quite normal for one to feel lost, scared, or even regretful initially. But he also added that with time, things would change: effort, persistence, and attitude would bring meaning to what we would do and later on, I realised it, and He reminded me that even when we feel lost at the beginning of a journey, the right guidance can illuminate the path ahead. Because of that, I am forever grateful.

Scenario-2 

it's really impressive to see a mentor like our Honourable Ramaguru Sir. 29th Oct, As many of us thought, and the stories I had heard from seniors added fuel to this presumption that all staff in the college will be strict and will be menacing the students. But when I came to know about our mentors, I gradually became familiar with my surroundings and the staff. I realised how mistaken I had been, particularly after meeting our Honourable Ramaguru Sir. I realised He is not only a generous person but a chill guy, someone who knows how to connect with younger minds while maintaining his status as a respected teacher. 
When he came to know about our problem, he didn't neglect it as it was not his problem; instead, he stood with us and solved it. There was an ease in the way he interacted with students, making even the most nervous among us feel relaxed. His approach did not rely on maintaining distance to gain respect. It was refreshing to see a mentor who understood that students needed guidance more than discipline, someone who recognised that every learner comes with their own set of struggles and uncertainties.
 A small conversation with him can uplift your mood, give you confidence, and remind you that college is not just about classes and exams, but it’s also about growth, relationships, and learning the values of empathy and teamwork. His kindness doesn't stop at problem-solving but extends to the encouragement he gave us in becoming better human beings. He taught more through actions than words and showed that a true leader understands and supports. He transformed what I once feared into something I now appreciate and enjoy. I am so grateful to have a mentor like Ramaguru Sir.

Scenario-3

At last,I have always wanted to take a moment and express my deep appreciation for all the hardworking individuals in our institution, quietly keeping everything running smoothly, often without recognition and praise. They also work with commitment and integrity from early morning to late evening. Whether it be the upkeep of facilities, ensuring safety, or maintaining essential services, it is their consistency and reliability that keep our environment functional and comfortable. Their motivation strikes a chord with me; most of them work as hard, not just for their own personal growth and development but also to provide stability and opportunity for their families. Their commitment towards their service reflects love and responsibility, virtues worthy of high respect.
They inspire me to put in more effort, appreciate the value of every role, and remember that success is built on collective labour. Today and always, I thank them for being the unsung heroes of our institution.
