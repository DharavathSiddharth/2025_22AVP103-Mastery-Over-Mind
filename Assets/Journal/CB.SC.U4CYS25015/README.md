# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
Scenario 1: 
Gratitude for the Friends I Met During My B.Tech Journey (August 2025 – May 2029).When I joined my B.Tech program in August 2025, I was filled with excitement and
nervous anticipation. I was stepping into a new phase of life, one that I had heard would be the most memorable and formative of all. What I didn’t realize then
was that the real treasure of my engineering journey wouldn’t just be the knowledge I gained or the degree I earned — it would be the people I met along the way.
Over four years, I formed deep and lasting friendships with a few extraordinary individuals: harshini , supragna and valli. They weren’t just classmates; they
became my chosen family, shaping who I am today. This gratitude journal entry is dedicated to them — for the laughter, the shared struggles, the emotional 
support, and the countless moments that turned my B.Tech years into a lifetime of memories.The first day of college is still etched vividly in my mind. Everything
felt unfamiliar — the large campus, the bustling crowd, and the nervous energy that every fresher carried. During the orientation session, I happened to sit next 
to a girl named valli, who had the same confused look on her face that I did. We exchanged awkward smiles and ended up partnering for the first group task. That
simple pairing turned into a friendship that would last throughout my entire college life. Later that week, I met harshini and supragna during our first lab
session. They were both struggling to configure a circuit, and I offered to help. Within minutes, we were joking and laughing as if we had known each other for
years. That day, something clicked — and from then on, the four of us became inseparable.During the initial months, everything seemed new and exciting — the
lectures, the campus canteen, and the freedom that came with hostel life. But as the semesters rolled by, we began facing the real challenges of engineering life
— endless assignments, lab reports, internal exams, and project submissions. It was in those chaotic moments that our friendship truly deepened. We pulled 
countless all-nighters together, working on lab files and presentations. Sometimes, we would stay up until 3 AM, switching between studying and discussing random 
life topics. Those nights taught me that friendship isn’t only about fun; it’s also about teamwork, understanding, and mutual patience.One incident that stands 
out vividly happened during our third semester in November 2026. We had a surprise internal test that none of us were prepared for. The syllabus was vast, and I
remember feeling completely lost. Supragna, who had a knack for understanding complex topics quickly, took it upon himself to explain the entire subject to us
overnight. He stayed up late, drawing diagrams on the whiteboard in our hostel room and simplifying every concept until we all understood. The next day, we all
passed with good marks — but more than the grades, it was the spirit of teamwork and selflessness that stayed with me. That was the first time I truly felt 
grateful for the kind of friends I had found — people who lifted each other up instead of competing.As we progressed into the later semesters, our bond only grew
stronger. Harshini was the emotional anchor of the group. Whenever anyone felt low — whether due to academic stress or personal issues — she was the one who
listened patiently and offered comfort. During my fifth semester in 2027, I went through a particularly tough time. My internship application had been rejected,
and I felt disheartened. I began doubting my capabilities and even considered switching my specialization. It was harshini who sat me down and said, “You’re more
capable than you think. One rejection doesn’t define your worth.” Those words, spoken with such conviction, reignited my confidence. Two months later, I applied 
again and successfully secured an internship. That experience made me realize that true friends not only celebrate your victories but also hold you together 
through your failures.valli, on the other hand, was the problem-solver of our group — both technically and emotionally. He was the one we turned to whenever
something went wrong. I still remember the final year project in February 2029, when our code crashed the night before the submission. Everyone panicked, and I 
could feel the pressure mounting. Neeraj calmly stepped in, analyzed the issue, and fixed it within hours. But what impressed me most was his attitude — he never
blamed anyone, never got angry, and always reminded us that “mistakes mean progress.” His ability to stay composed under pressure inspired me to develop the same 
calmness in my own approach to challenges.Beyond academics, we created countless memories that still make me smile — spontaneous bike rides after class,
celebrating birthdays with midnight cakes, participating in cultural fests, and taking group trips during semester breaks. One of my favorite memories is from 
January 2026, when we went on an impromptu trek to Nandi Hills. We started before sunrise, laughing and talking all the way up. Watching the sunrise from the top,
with cold wind on our faces and laughter echoing around, felt like pure freedom. In that moment, I realized how lucky I was — not just to have friends, but to 
have these friends. It was one of those rare times in life when everything felt right.By the time our final semester arrived in 2029, we had matured together — 
from nervous freshmen to confident graduates ready to face the world. But the thought of parting ways brought mixed emotions. On our last day of college, after
the farewell ceremony, we sat together in our favorite spot near the campus library. There was laughter, silence, and a few tears. We reminisced about our journey
— the fights, the fun, the fear before exams, and the pride of achievements. It struck me that what made our bond so special was not just shared interests but 
shared growth. We had witnessed each other’s evolution — from naïve teenagers into responsible young adults. That kind of shared history is priceless.Today, as I 
write this journal, I feel immense gratitude toward harshini, supragna, and valli. They were more than just friends; they were my teachers in their own ways.
Supragna taught me perseverance, harshini taught me compassion, and supragna taught me calmness. They made my engineering journey more meaningful than any textbook
ever could. Even now, though we’ve gone our separate ways — with different jobs, cities, and dreams — our bond remains intact. We still talk almost every weekend,
sharing updates, jokes, and occasional nostalgia about our college days.What I’ve learned from this friendship is that gratitude isn’t limited to grand gestures
or special occasions. It lives in the everyday — in shared laughter, mutual support, and small acts of care. The friends I met during my B.Tech taught me that
success feels incomplete when you have no one to share it with. They turned my college years into a beautiful blend of learning, laughter, and emotional growth.
And for that, I will forever remain grateful.

have learned that ethics and discipline form the backbone of this profession. I am thankful to him for instilling in us this sense of responsibility. Because of 
him, I now understand that being a cybersecurity student is not just about learning how to hack — it’s about learning how to protect and defend.Learning under Mr.
Saurabh Sir has not only improved my technical knowledge but also helped me grow personally. He encourages teamwork, communication, and self-discipline. Whenever
we worked on group assignments or presentations, he taught us how to collaborate effectively and respect everyone’s ideas. These experiences have made me more 
confident and mature as a student.He also constantly pushes us to step out of our comfort zones. Whether it’s presenting a topic in front of the class or 
explaining a cybersecurity tool to others, he ensures that every student gets a chance to speak and participate. I am thankful for how these activities have 
improved my public speaking, leadership, and teamwork skills.Like any technical subject, Cyber Security Essentials can be challenging at times. There were moments
when I struggled to understand certain concepts, or when my lab tasks failed repeatedly. But every time, Saurabh Sir encouraged me not to give up. He would say, 
“In cybersecurity, failure is just feedback. Learn from it and move forward.”Those words taught me resilience and patience. I now understand that challenges are 
part of learning, and mistakes are opportunities to improve. I’m truly grateful to him for helping me build that mindset.Teaching cybersecurity requires constant
