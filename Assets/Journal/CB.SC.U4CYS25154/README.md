Bhavishya and Yasaswini
                        I feel truly blessed to share my hostel room with two wonderful people — Bhavishya and Yasaswini. Both of them have brought so much positivity, laughter, and warmth into my everyday life. Living together has not only made this new chapter of college easier but also more meaningful.Yasaswini is someone I was already familiar with before we became roommates. She was my classmate and also a friend from my previous college. When I found out that she would be sharing this journey with me again, I felt instantly at ease. Having a familiar face in a new environment gave me a sense of comfort and reassurance. She has a very calm and pleasant personality — someone who can brighten up the atmosphere without even trying. Yasaswini is thoughtful and caring, the kind of person who listens patiently and gives genuine advice when needed. Her presence brings a sense of balance to our room, and her cheerful nature makes even ordinary days feel special.Bhavishya, on the other hand, is someone I got to know after moving in. From the very beginning, she has been warm, friendly, and open-hearted. Over time, we have become very good friends. She is someone who always makes an effort to understand others, which makes living with her so easy and comfortable. Of course, like in any close friendship, we had a small disagreement once. But what I appreciate most is that we handled it maturely — we talked it out honestly the same day and cleared all misunderstandings. That moment of honesty and openness made our bond even stronger. It showed me that true friendship is not about never having conflicts, but about how we handle them with care and respect.Both Bhavishya and Yasaswini are incredibly kind, understanding, and supportive. Each of them has a unique personality that adds something special to our little room. We share laughter, late-night talks, and even moments of quiet companionship when everyone is busy with their own work. These small yet meaningful moments have made our hostel life truly memorable.I admire how both of them create such a positive and peaceful environment. We share responsibilities, respect each other’s space, and always try to keep things harmonious. Whenever one of us feels low, the others are quick to lift the mood — sometimes with comforting words, sometimes with shared silence that speaks volumes. There’s a comforting sense of belonging that comes from knowing that no matter what kind of day I’ve had, I can come back to a space filled with warmth and understanding.Living with Bhavishya and Yasaswini has taught me a lot about friendship, patience, and communication. I’ve learned that a good roommate is not just someone you share a room with, but someone you share your life with — your laughter, your worries, your stories, and your dreams. I’m truly grateful for both of them and the way our friendship continues to grow.I genuinely hope that the bond we share stays strong throughout our four years here and even beyond. Having such good-hearted roommates makes hostel life not just comfortable, but joyful and full of memories that I’ll cherish forever.
#Third Scenario# 
September,2025
My friends
      I feel truly blessed to have such amazing friends — Sathwika, Maneesha, Nethra, Harshitha, Amrita, Mansi, Aadi, Midun, Advik, and Sreekanth. Even though the time we have spent together has been relatively short, it has been filled with countless moments of joy, laughter, and togetherness that have already left a lasting impression on my heart. Each one of them has added something special to my life, and when I think about our days together, I can’t help but feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude and happiness.Friendship, to me, is one of the most beautiful gifts life can offer. It’s not about how long we have known each other, but about how deeply we connect and how sincerely we care. With this wonderful group of friends, I have experienced the kind of genuine companionship that makes life brighter and more meaningful. They have shown me that even a short period can be enough to build strong bonds when hearts are open and kind.When I first came to college, I wasn’t sure how things would unfold. I was placed in Section B, while my roommates were all in Section A, and that initially made me feel a little sad and lonely. I missed the comfort of familiar faces and was worried about how I would adjust in a new group. But, as life often does, it surprised me in the most beautiful way. During that time, I met Sathwika, and our friendship slowly began to grow. She became one of the first people to make me feel truly comfortable in my new environment. With her kind nature and genuine warmth, she helped me find my footing again.Sathwika has a gentle and caring personality. She has a way of making people feel heard and understood. There’s a calm strength in her that reassures those around her. Whenever I’ve had doubts or felt uncertain, she’s been there — not just to listen, but to comfort and guide me in her own quiet, thoughtful way. Our bond has grown naturally, built on trust, understanding, and mutual respect. I’m deeply thankful for her presence in my life and for all the little moments that have strengthened our friendship.Then there’s Maneesha, whose cheerful energy never fails to lift everyone’s spirits. She has a lively and friendly nature that instantly makes people feel included. Maneesha brings light-heartedness wherever she goes. Her laughter is contagious, and her positive outlook reminds me that even on tough days, there’s always something to smile about. She has the gift of turning ordinary moments into memories simply through her enthusiasm and charm.Nethra is thoughtful and grounded — someone who balances the group with her calm and steady nature. She observes, listens, and always knows how to make others feel at ease. There’s a quiet strength about her, and she has this beautiful ability to bring peace into conversations, even when things get chaotic. Her sincerity and maturity are qualities I truly admire.Harshitha adds so much warmth and joy to our circle. She is caring, affectionate, and always ready to help others. Her kindness is effortless, and her friendly attitude makes her approachable to everyone. Whether it’s through a small gesture or a comforting word, she has a way of making people feel valued and appreciated. Being around her always brings a sense of comfort and positivity.Amrita is creative, intelligent, and full of enthusiasm. She has a curious mind and a thoughtful way of expressing herself. Her ability to balance fun and responsibility makes her someone everyone enjoys being around. Amrita adds color to every conversation — whether we’re talking about studies, plans, or just sharing random thoughts. Her energy is inspiring, and she encourages those around her to think freely and be confident in their own ideas.Mansi is kind-hearted and genuine. She has a simple, pure-hearted nature that makes her friendship feel safe and comforting. With her, I can be myself without hesitation. Mansi’s calmness is one of her best qualities — she brings stability to our group and is always there to listen without judgment. Her quiet strength reminds me that true friendship doesn’t always need big words; sometimes, it’s about silent understanding and mutual respect.Aadi is fun-loving and easygoing — someone who always brings laughter wherever he goes. His sense of humor and lighthearted attitude make even the most ordinary days feel lively. Yet, beyond his playful side, Aadi is also caring and dependable. He knows how to make people feel included and appreciated, and his ability to bring joy to others is truly something special.Midun is intelligent, composed, and thoughtful. He’s the kind of friend who listens before he speaks and always offers meaningful insights. His presence brings balance to our group, and he often helps us see things from a different perspective. He has a calm way of handling things, which often helps keep the mood peaceful even when situations get confusing or stressful.Advik is another wonderful friend — kind, optimistic, and full of positive energy. He has a natural ability to connect with people and to make them feel at ease. He’s supportive and understanding, and his friendliness makes everyone around him feel welcomed and valued. Advik’s optimistic attitude reminds us all to look at the brighter side of things.And then there’s Sreekanth, who brings humor, honesty, and liveliness to the group. He is straightforward and fun to be around, and his presence makes any gathering more entertaining. He has a great sense of humor, but also a genuine and caring side that shows when someone needs help or support. His ability to make people laugh and feel comfortable is one of the many reasons he’s such an important part of our circle.Together, these ten amazing people have created memories that I will carry with me for a long time. Whether it was sharing simple conversations, laughing over silly jokes, working together, or just spending time in each other’s company, every moment has been special. The best part about this group is the comfort and understanding we share — there’s never any pretense or pressure to be someone we’re not. We simply enjoy being ourselves, and that’s what makes our friendship so genuine.I truly hope that as time goes by, our bond continues to grow stronger. I wish for our friendship to stay free of misunderstandings or distance, because connections like these are rare and precious. Each one of them has taught me something — about kindness, patience, joy, and the value of human connection.Even though our time together so far has been short, it has been enough to make me realize how fortunate I am to have crossed paths with such wonderful souls. True friends are hard to find, and I feel deeply grateful to have found them. Life may change, classes may end, and we may all go our separate ways someday, but the laughter, warmth, and memories we’ve created will always remain close to my heart.With love and gratitude, I thank all of them — Sathwika, Maneesha, Nethra, Harshitha, Amrita, Mansi, Aadi, Midun, Advik, and Sreekanth — for making my college life brighter, happier, and so much more meaningful. Their friendship is a gift I will always cherish, and I truly hope that no matter where life takes us, the bond we share will stay strong forever.
