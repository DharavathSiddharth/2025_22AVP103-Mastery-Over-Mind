I am thank full to our FIH faculty Karthik sharma sir .I am thankfull to him not a day i am thank full to every class of him. I did not really know anything about Indian culture before attending Karthik Sharma Sir's classes. I knew about the festivals, rituals, and customs that were performed, but I really didn't understand their meaning or importance. His way of teaching opened my mind to learning in a whole new dimension. He never spoke about traditions; he explained in detail the deep science, logic, and philosophy behind them. For the first time, I realized how Indian culture is not outdated, as people often think it is, but much more advanced, balanced, and meaningful compared to many modern systems existing in the world.His classes made me realize that India's culture is not all about rituals or customs, but it's a way of living life in harmony, connecting body, mind, and soul. He showed us how our ancestors were wise, spiritual, and ahead of their time to understand the universe, human psychology, and nature. Be it art, architecture, mathematics, science, or spirituality, the list of contributions of India to the world is endless. Listening to him speak so enthusiastically, I felt proud to belong to such a great civilization. I had thought Dharma meant religion until I attended his class. But he explained it so nicely — that Dharma isn't a religion; it is a way of living with righteousness and a purpose. Dharma teaches us to do what is right, even when it is difficult, and to live in harmony with others. He said that every person has their own Dharma depending on their role — as a student, child, or citizen — and fulfilling these duties sincerely brings peace and balance in life.I cannot say that I am practicing Dharma perfectly, I have definitely started making efforts to live by it. These little changes have made me feel much more at peace with myself and responsible.Discovering the Meaning of “Kosas” and the Happiness of the SoulAnother interesting idea that Karthik Sharma Sir discussed with us was the Kosas, or five layers or sheaths of human existence, according to ancient Indian philosophy. He spoke to us about Annamaya Kosha, the physical body; Pranamaya Kosha, the energy body; Manomaya Kosha, the mental body; Vijnanamaya Kosha, the wisdom body; and Anandamaya Kosha, the bliss body. In his explanation, I learned that true happiness does not come from material comfort and physical health but from raising and taking care of all layers.
