# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind
Date: 11/11/2025 Subject: The three people I met in my college, who I'm grateful to.

**Sourabh sir**: I'm grateful for having a teacher like sourabh sir. Sourabh sir is a calm and cool teacher, sir is very observative in class and knows whether a student knows the answer to his question or not- just by seeing their faces. Sir is always ok with doubts and if you have a doubt, he would stop at that point and explain the topic again so that you would understand. Even if we don't understand it then, sir will dedicate time after the class to explain it to us. Sir is very flexible with his classes, sir would call off the class if he feels it would be a lot for the day if he continues explaining. This is the very reason I am able to better understand his class. Sir is always okay to change his teaching method if we feel that we are not able to understand the topic in the current method of teaching. Sir is very open minded, initially sir didn't used to send the chapter ppts to the students, but after mentioning that we are unable to revise the concepts earlier taught in class, sir changed his mind and started sharing the ppts to us.

**Yuva Teja**: Yuva is my classmate and is a very good person. He doesn't give a damn about what others t hink about him. He focuses only on the beautiful aspects of life like making memories and living in the moment. He is a very good photographer and takes nice aesthetic pictures of the nature.He taught me Bitterness is a repeating cycle of life which we should face calmly and steadily. Yuva has taught me to interact with many people, becoming more interactive with others. Yuva's experience teaches me who to believe in and who not to believe in. Yuva is a person with a great heart who forgives a person who lost his trust or even cheated him. Yuva as a person teaches me a lot of things in life.

**Sandilya**: Sandilya is a person who beleives in dharma and righteousness. Even though he sometimes fails to act in a dharmic and righteous manner, he accepts and learns from his mistakes.He is a person of wisdom and doesn't have any evil intentions towards anyone even though they try to hurt him. He taught me to be a kind person and have trust in people which I lacked at start. Sandilya has helped me a lot of times. He is the person I always ask doubts about assignment and lab assessments. Sandilya is a very spiritual person, he only prays mata amritanandamaye everyday. For him amma is the greatest person in the world. For me, he is the ammas greatest devotee. He always prays to amma in the morning. He has ammas photo on his desk and won't keep quiet if anyone says anything to amma. Sandilya always tries to not speak unparliamentaly language, Even throught he fails to do so many times, he reminds himself and others to not speak unparliamentary language and speak dharma.
