## Journal Record
 Gratitude journal:
  Roomates:
           my roomates made my room feel like home and not a new place,Creating a Sense of Belonging When I first moved in, I felt nervous about living with people I didn’t know. I was worried about awkward silences, misunderstandings, and having my space invaded. But from day one, my roommates made a real effort to welcome me. They introduced themselves, shared their routines, and created an environment that felt safe and inclusive. I remember how they invited me to join them for dinner on my first night. I had just arrived and was still trying to settle in, feeling a bit overwhelmed. Instead of leaving me to figure it out, they included me in their plans. It was just a casual meal, but it meant a lot. That first dinner led to many shared meals and late-night talks, making me realize I wasn’t alone in this new chapter of my life. Since then, they’ve made sure I feel included in everything, whether it’s watching movies together after a long week or going out for coffee. They’ve been more than just roommates; they’ve become my support network, helping me feel like I truly belong here. 2. Emotional Support and Genuine Friendship Living with my roommates has taught me the value of emotional support. College can be overwhelming, and I’ve faced my share of tough days. Whether it’s stress from exams, homesickness, or the challenge of juggling everything, there have been times when I felt like I couldn’t handle it all. During those moments, my roommates were always there, offering a listening ear or a distraction when I needed it most. I remember one day when I was really down after getting a disappointing grade on a project I worked hard on. I was sitting in the living room, trying to hide my frustration, when one of my roommates noticed. Without asking too many questions, they sat down next to me and offered me a cup of tea. We didn’t talk about the grade right away. They just listened as I vented about everything weighing on me. Being heard without judgment was exactly what I needed. In that moment, I felt seen and supported in a way that words alone could never express. That’s the kind of friendship we’ve built—one rooted in genuine care and understanding. We’ve been there for each other through the ups and downs, and those moments of emotional support have strengthened our bond. 3. The Little Things That Make Life Easier Sometimes, gratitude comes from small, everyday things. I really appreciate how considerate and thoughtful my roommates are, making our living situation run smoothly. Whether it’s taking out the trash without being asked, cleaning up after a shared meal, or simply checking in on how my day went, these little gestures make a big difference in creating a comfortable living space. There’s comfort in the routine we’ve developed—knowing that the dishes will be done, that the apartment will be cleaned regularly, and that we all respect each other’s space. It’s easy to take these things for granted, but when I think about it, I realize it’s the mutual respect and cooperation that make living together enjoyable. Then there are the spontaneous acts of kindness. For instance, when one of us has had a tough day, they leave little notes of encouragement or drop by with a snack. This thoughtfulness shows they care about how we’re feeling, and it means more than I can express. In a world where it often feels like we’re all moving in our own direction, these small acts of kindness remind me that we’re a team—looking out for one another and making life a little easier.
