GRATITUDE JOURNAL
1.SCENARIO-1
  AUGUST 2025 to Present
Person: My Roommate and Good Friend (Gagana)
When I think about people I am truly thankful for, the first person that comes to my mind is Gagana, my roommate. I met her last year in august 2025, when I started living in the hostel for college. Everything was new for me—new place, new college, and away from my family for the first time. At first, I was really nervous and honestly, I didn’t know how I was going to handle so many changes at once. But then I met Ananya, and things slowly started to get better.
From the very first day, Gagana has been very kind and friendly to me. She made me feel comfortable in our room. I still remember how she helped me with arranging my things that first evening, when I was feeling lost. She cracked some silly jokes and shared her snacks with me. That made me less homesick and helped me settle in quicker. I felt happy knowing that I had a roommate who really cared. One thing I am most thankful for is how much Gagana helps me with my studies. I always find some subjects tough, especially physics and maths. Whenever I get stuck with doubts, she is always ready to explain things, no matter how many times I ask. She patiently teaches me and gives examples, and she never gets angry if I take time to understand. Before exams, we stay up late revising together—she keeps me focused when I get distracted and even encourages me not to give up. During those nights, we make tea in our room and sometimes even study sitting on the floor with all our books and notes spread out. She makes boring study times actually enjoyable. 
There was one time in October 2023, just before the mid-term exams, when I was really stressed. I couldn’t remember one topic and thought I was going to fail. That’s when Gagana sat with me and explained everything step by step. She made sure I understood, even drawing simple diagrams for me. After that, I felt much more confident for the exam. That night I realized how lucky I am to have her as my friend.
But she hasn’t just helped me with studies. I remember in January 2024, I got sick with fever. I was too weak to get out of bed. Gagana took care of me like my own sister—she got food from the mess, brought me medicine, and made sure I drank enough water and rested. Because of her, I didn’t feel alone or scared of being sick away from home. She even helped me talk to the teacher about my assignment deadline. I truly felt thankful to have such a caring friend at that time.
Every day, Gagana does small things that really matter. If I need something from the store, she brings it when she goes out. If I forget to bring lunch, she shares her food with me. If I am feeling low, she listens to me and cheers me up with her jokes or just by spending time with me. She never makes me feel like I am troubling her. She always says, That’s what friends are for.
One of my favorite memories is from my birthday in February 2024. I was feeling sad because I missed home. But Gagana surprised me by decorating our room and getting a small cake. We both laughed, danced, and clicked funny pictures. Because of her, my special day became truly special, and I didn’t miss home that much.
Living together has made our friendship even stronger. We know each other’s good habits and bad habits. Sometimes we fight over silly things, like who should clean the room or whose turn it is to switch off the light at night. But after a few minutes, we always laugh about it. She always says sorry first, even if it is my mistake. I have learned a lot from her about being patient, sharing, and forgiving.
There are so many small ways in which Gagana makes my life better every day. She helps me arrange my timetable, reminds me about important college events, and even helps me pick what to wear for special occasions. When we are both worried about results or assignments, we support each other and never let the other person feel down.
Gagana is more than just a roommate—she is truly my best friend and feels like my family in this new city. College life is full of ups and downs, but with her, I feel I can handle everything. Because of her, our hostel room feels like a real home. Sometimes, before going to sleep, we talk about what we want to achieve in life. I really hope all her dreams come true, and I will do my best to support her always.
When I look back, I understand the real meaning of gratitude. To me, gratitude is feeling thankful for people like Gagana, who bring smiles, help, and support in difficult times. I hope to always be a good friend to her as she has been to me. If I ever move away or we don’t stay together in future, I will never forget all these things she has done for me.
So, my gratitude journal starts with Gagana , my friend and roommate, who has made this past year so much happier and easier. I feel very lucky and happy to share my college life with her.



2.SCENARIO-2
 November 5th 2025
Person: Kind Old Uncle (Shop Customer Near the Store)

I want to write about something that happened in August 2024, which made me feel very thankful. It was one normal evening after our classes. Me and my friend needed to buy a few things for our hostel room—some groceries, snacks—so we decided to walk to a store that was a bit far from our hostel. We thought it would be fun to go together and also get some fresh air after a long day.
The walk to the store took longer than we expected. By the time we reached, we were tired and just wanted to get done and go back to relax. When we started picking things we needed, we realised we didn’t bring any cash; we only had money in our PhonePe app for UPI payment. It was a small shop and we saw that the shopkeeper didn’t have any way to accept UPI, only cash.
We checked all our pockets and bags to see if we could find just enough money, but we didn’t have any cash at all. If we wanted to get the things we needed, we had to go all the way back to our hostel, pick up money, and then come again. The hostel is so far from the shop that it would take at least half an hour of walking back. Both of us were feeling helpless because we were tired and really needed the things for the night.
While we were standing and getting worried, a kind old uncle who was nearby noticed our problem. He was another customer in the shop and looked very simple and friendly. He walked up to us and asked, Is everything okay? You both seem to be upset. We explained what happened, and he immediately said, Don’t worry, children—I can help. He opened his wallet and gave us enough money to buy all our things.
We felt so surprised and thankful at that moment. Uncle was a total stranger, but he trusted us and helped us without expecting anything in return. He even smiled and said, It happens sometimes. It’s just money, you can return it later. Because of his help, we were able to buy everything without wasting time and without having to go all the way back to hostel. returned the money with many thanks. We told him how much it meant to us, and he just smiled and said, You don’t need to thank me so much. I am happy to help. When you get a chance, help someone else in need. I really liked his attitude and kindness.
That small event taught me something important. There are good people all around us, even if we don’t always see it. Kindness comes from unexpected places. Uncle taught me that helping others can be simple, and that we should trust people sometimes, just like he trusted us. Whenever I see someone struggling, I think of that uncle and feel that I should try my best to help them, no matter how small my help is.
This experience made me feel so grateful. Whenever I go back to that store, I remember that day and feel happy inside, knowing that kindness is real and people can be good. 

3.SCENARIO-3
  August 2025 to Present
Person: My Cyber Essentials Lecturer (Mr. Saurabh Sir)

I want to write about someone who has really helped me in my studies this year—my Cyber Essentials lecturer, Mr.Saurabh sir. He started teaching us in August 2025, when our new semester began. Honestly, before this, I was a little scared of computer and cyber topics because they always seemed very tough. But ever since I started attending his classes, I feel a big difference in how I look at these subjects.
The best thing about Mr.Saurabh sir  is that he teaches in a very clear and simple way. Every time I sit in his class, I feel like everything just makes sense. He does not use difficult words and never tries to show off. When he explains something, he gives us real-life examples, which makes it much easier for me and my friends to understand every topic. For example, when he taught us about passwords and online safety, he showed how to create strong passwords using easy tricks. This made me remember the rules without having to mug them up.
Sometimes, if someone in the class doesn’t understand the concept, he happily repeats it again. He does not get impatient or angry. Instead, he explains in a different way until we all are clear. Because of his teaching style, even students who usually find computer subjects hard are now able to follow along. I remember the topic Subnet topic was very confusing for me. I couldn’t get it at first, but he patiently explained it using a simple story. After that, I understood it perfectly.
Whenever I leave his class, I always feel like I have actually learned something new and useful for my life. He tells us which things are important for real life and which questions usually come in exams, which helps us focus better. He also shares practical tips like how to protect our phones and computer from hackers, and how to identify fake messages online.
What I also like is how friendly and supportive he is. If we have doubts after class, he never says he is too busy. He is always ready to talk, either in the classroom or even if we meet him outside. He asks if we are understanding the lessons and gives extra notes when someone requests. When we feel nervous before exams, he encourages us and tells us not to worry, but to prepare well, and everything will be fine.
Thanks to him, my interest in the subject has grown a lot. Earlier, I just wanted to pass the exam, but now I enjoy learning about cyber safety and technology. I feel much more confident to use the internet and help my friends and family stay safe online. Sometimes, I even explain some topics to my roommates, using his teaching tricks.
I am really thankful to Mr.Saurabh sir for his patience and support. He treats every student equally and wants all of us to do well. Because of him, I feel less scared of computer subjects and even look forward to learning new things in class. Having a teacher like him makes a big difference. He puts in the effort to make difficult topics simple and interesting.
I feel lucky to be in his class this semester. Good teachers are not always easy to find, and I now realize how important a good teacher is for students. He has inspired me to be more curious and not be afraid of asking questions. If I ever become a teacher in the future, I want to teach just like him—always in a way that students can easily understand and feel supported.
Mr.Saurabh sir is truly one of the best teachers I have had, and I am very grateful for all his efforts.
