GRATITUDE JOURNAL 
Scenario1:(08/08/2025)
I am grateful for my roommates Harshitha, Mansi and Amirtha for making life easier here in Amrita they always make sure to check on me when I am feeling down they always try to cheer me up.
Entering a vast and completely new world, such as Amrita, can be a dizzying mix of feelings: excitement, sense of freedom, and a fleeting, nagging sense of loneliness. One could feel like a little, solitary boat in an enormous ocean, forging one's way through new academic pressures, a new environment, and a new way of life away from the comforts of home. In this big ocean, I was ready to find classmates and acquaintances, but never a lighthouse. Well, as it would happen, I found three: my roommates, Harshitha, Mansi, and Amirtha. Without any exaggeration, they are those who turned this place from a "hostel" into a "home," making life not just easier but richer and more joyful. They constitute my found family, and this is my meager attempt at describing what they mean to me.

It is not some occasional, grand gesture of care; it's woven into the fabric of my daily life right from when my day starts. They're my human alarm clocks, the watchmen and women of my well-being. My bed is my sanctuary, and I am notorious for wanting to skip breakfast, but that's a battle I am not allowed to win. Every single morning, without fail, they make sure I am up. It could be Mansi's nonstop nudging, Harshitha's quiet firm "get up," or Amirtha's threat of dragging me out-but the combined effort is impregnable against my own sullenness. This extends into every meal. They never let me skip one meal, intuitively knowing, perhaps better than I do, that a fed student is a functional one. And this relentless daily care, though it may seem small to an outsider, is to me the most overwhelming act of love: the constant, steady reminder of being looked after, of health and well-being as important as everyone else's.

This protective instinct goes way beyond just meals. They are my emotional guardians. They seem to have this almost psychic ability to know when I am down, even when I am trying my best to mask it. When I am quiet, they don't let me retreat into myself. They are the first to check on me, to sit with me, to gently pry until I talk. They don't just ask "what's wrong?" and move on; they sit with me in the silence, they listen to the rants, and then they deploy their unique strategies to cheer me up. Mansi, my wonderful social media buddy, instinctively knows which meme or video will crack my composure, and we fall into this familiar rhythm of scrolling and laughing, our shared sense of humor a language all our own. They are my first defense against sadness, and their presence has pulled me back from the brink of a bad mood more times than I can count.

I saw the true depth of their care earlier this semester, a time I will never forget. I woke up one morning feeling absolutely terrible, a fever climbing rapidly and my whole body aching. Being sick at home is one thing, but being sick in a hostel, you feel a profound sense of isolation. That fear lasted for about ten minutes before they took over. They went into full "emergency mode" with a calm efficiency that was breathtaking. Harshitha, my "cool, introverted" anchor, was the quiet-but-powerful force. She didn't say much, but she was the one who went to the pharmacy, returned with medicine, a thermometer, and a bottle of water, and just placed them on my nightstand with a look that said, "You will take this." Amirtha, my other introverted friend who is secretly "ready to do anything," became a fierce protector, making sure our room was quiet, coordinating with our friends, and even dealing with the hostel warden to get permissions. And Mansi, my kindred spirit, was my nurturer. She braved the mess hall to bring back the only things I could stomach-toast and hot tea-and sat with me, forcing me to drink water and making sure I wasn't scared. They took shifts, they checked my temperature, and they didn't leave my side. In those few days, I wasn't just a sick roommate; I was their patient, their responsibility, their friend. They cared for me with a tenderness I would only expect from my own mother.

It is this combination of personalities that makes our room work. Harshitha's cool, introverted nature is a source of calm strength for all of us; she is the steady, logical one who balances us out. Amirtha, while also quiet, has a spark of pure adventure, an "I'm-ready-for-anything" spirit that pushes us to try new things and be brave. And then there's Mansi. She is my social media buddy, yes, but she is so much more. The "lot of similarities" we share run deep; it often feels like we share the same brain, able to communicate with just a look. She is my confidante, my partner in crime, and the person who understands my internal world better than anyone. Each of them is a brilliant, caring, and wonderful person in her own right, and I am so incredibly lucky to be surrounded by them. In a place like Amrita, you meet new people every day. We all make friends in our classes, in clubs, and in the canteen, but I must say one thing: no matter how many new friends we make, they will never, ever dilute the importance of Harshitha, Mansi, and Amirtha. They are not just friends; they are my priority, my inner circle, my non-negotiables. My gratitude for them is boundless. Yes, they have made my life here easier, but more importantly, they have made it better. They are my support system, my cheerleaders, my nurses, and the best friends I could have ever asked for. I came to Amrita for an education, but it is these three women who are teaching me what unconditional love, loyalty, and true sisterhood look like.












Scenario2:(A month after joining Amrita)
I am grateful to my friends I met here apart from my roommates Maneesha, Deepthi, Sathwika, Sreekanth, Advik, AadiDevan, Midhun and Bhavishya they are the reason I always have a smile on my face and they also help me academically.
The first month in a new university is a period of intense, chaotic change. It's all one blur of new faces, new buildings, and that completely new, daunting sense of independence. Amidst the whirlwind of joining Amrita, academic pressure was overwhelming in itself, and the fear of not finding my place is a quiet anxiety every new student carries. I was prepared for a long, slow process of making connections. I was not prepared for the incredible, immediate gift of finding a group of friends who, in just one month, have already become the reason I always wear a smile. My roommates are my base, but this group-Maneesha, Deepthi, Sathwika, Sreekanth, Advik, AadiDevan, Midhun, and Bhavishya-is my lifeline.

My greatest appreciation is rooted in the academic support that has, quite literally, saved me. Coming into Amrita without a background in Computer Science, I was basically swimming in a sea of acronyms, coding languages, and complicated logic that my classmates seemed to pick up instinctively. It was a huge source of stress, and I genuinely was afraid of falling behind permanently. This is where Advik and Sreekanth became my academic superheroes. I really cannot "butter them up" enough because they deserve every compliment. They have shown me patience on a different level than anything I have ever experienced. Where my studies are concerned, they are not just helpful but true teachers. We will sit down with a problem, and they will not just give me the answer but instead patiently try to make me understand the whole concept right from the ground up, explaining things in three to four different ways until that "click" finally happens in my head. Many times, when I ask a very basic question, they have never once made me feel dumb for doing so; that kindness has given me the confidence to even try.

But this is no mere study circle; it's a source of consistent joy and laughter, and I'm just so happy being one of the social instigators along with Midhun. Midhun and I quickly found common grounds: we were both socially active, playful, and goofy. We're the reasons the group chat's always alive, and we took it upon ourselves to document our new friendship through the noblest of art forms: making memes about each and every member within the group. That fact that after one month we all feel very comfortable to laugh at these little inside jokes is pretty indicative. Beyond the teasing, we are also the "buttered toast" of the group, so to say-we are the ones who butter everybody up, who keep the mood light, and generally act as social glue. This mix of serious, academic focus and pure, silly fun really is what makes our dynamic so special. We work hard, but we laugh even harder, and that joy's infectious. But of course, university life isn't all academics or laughter; sometimes, it's coping with stress, homesickness, and personal problems that don't seem to magically disappear just because you're somewhere else. It is in this particular aspect that I found Maneesha to be this rather rare, selfless soul she isn the only person that i cant talk anything and everything to without having the fear of judgement i love the way she always listens to my yap and i am grateful to find her here. It's a deep thing, finding out someone who will not only listen but actually hear you. And Maneesha possesses this gift in so many incredible ways. She's the one I go to whenever I get overwhelmed-she will just listen. She gives me her full, undivided attention, letting me vent and process without judgment. What makes her most extraordinary-what I'm most grateful for-is that she does this even when I know she is going through something herself.It is the sum of Maneesha, Deepthi, Sathwika, Sreekanth, Advik, AadiDevan, Midhun, and Bhavishya that has defined my first month here. It's how Deepthi and Sathwika share their notes, the way AadiDevan and Bhavishya are always ready for a walk to the canteen, the way all eight of them have managed to create an environment of instant acceptance




Scenario 3:(09/08/2025)
On the first day a stranger helped me find route,which I am still grateful for or else I would’ve missed the whole orientation and many strangers helped me near canteen when my online payment was not working .
The first day at a new university is an experience that exists outside of normal time. It feels like a week crammed into a single, overwhelming day. I remember standing outside the hostel on the morning of August 9th, 2025 with the famous Amrita humidity already settling on my skin, feeling a dizzying cocktail of excitement, ambition, and pure, unadulterated panic. The campus was an ocean, and I was a single drop, suddenly released from the small, familiar glass I had lived in my whole life. I had a schedule, a map that might as well have been in a foreign language, and a terrible sense of direction. I was prepared for the classes, rules, and academic rigor. What I wasn't prepared for was the profound, immediate, and saving grace of human kindness.

My first baptism by fire arrived well within ten minutes. I was on a mission: get to the orientation. This was, I had been told, the single most important event of the day. Missing it would be catastrophic, like failing a class before it even began. I was walking with a false confidence, following a crowd that I assumed knew where it was going. But the crowd thinned, splitting off in different directions, and suddenly I was alone at a fork in the road, staring at two massive, identical-looking academic blocks. The panic was instantaneous and cold. I looked at my phone; the map app was spinning, and the dot that was "me" was hopelessly lost. I could feel the seconds ticking by. I was going to miss it. I was going to be the new student who, on the very first day, couldn't even find the auditorium. My whole orientation-my first official welcome-was about to be lost because I couldn't navigate a simple path.

The lessons for the day were not over, though. The orientation passed in a blur of speeches and new faces. Hours later, I faced the next great challenge: the lunchtime rush at the canteen. It was a wall of sound, people, and food smell. I navigated the line, got my plate, and approached the payment counter, feeling a small surge of pride. I could handle this. I was independent. I pulled out my phone to make my online payment, just as I had seen everyone else do. I scanned the code. The app buffered. Then, the three most dreaded words: "Transaction Failed." I tried again. "Transaction Failed." My face flushed hot with embarrassment. The cashier was staring at me with that practiced, impatient stare. A line was forming behind me, and I could feel the eyes of other students. It was a horrible, public kind of failure. I was holding up the line, I had a plate of food I couldn't pay for, and I didn't have any cash. My stomach tightened. I was about to do the only thing I could think of: apologize, abandon my food, and walk away hungry and mortified. As I turned to do just that, a voice came from my left. "Is the app not working?" I looked over to see a group of three or four students at a nearby table, watching me. I nodded, humiliated. "It's not. it's just not working," I mumbled. One stood up, walked over, and tapped his card on the reader before I could say another word. The payment went through in less than a second. The speed left me flabbergasted. "Oh, no, please, you don't have to do that!" I stuttered, fumbling for my phone. "I can get your number, I can pay you right now!" He smiled and waived his hand. "Don't bother," he said. "First day, this place has terrible Wi-Fi. It happens to everyone." His friends joined in. "Yeah, just get the next person," one of them said. "Welcome to Amrita." They returned to their own conversation just like they had never saved me from total public embarrassment. I picked up my food and found a table, my hands shaking a little. They didn't know me. They had no reason to help me. They just. did. They saved me, expecting nothing in return. I sat there, eating the lunch that strangers had bought for me, and I finally understood. I had been so worried about the classes and the rules and the giant, imposing buildings. But that's not what a university is: a university is people. My first day was defined not by the orientation speech that I can barely remember but by two simple and profound acts of kindness by people whose names I will never know. The student who walked me to the hall did not just save me from being late; he saved me from feeling invisible. The students at the canteen did not just buy me a meal; they bought me my dignity and showed me that I was already part of a community that looks out for its own. I am still and always will be grateful to them. They were the first to show me what it means to be a part of Amrita.,
