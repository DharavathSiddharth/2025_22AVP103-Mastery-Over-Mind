3.Today, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to my senior for the guidance, support, and encouragement I’ve received since joining college. Being a first-year student, everything felt new and a little overwhelming at first — new campus, new people, and new challenges. But having a senior like you made the transition so much easier.i think i am so much grateful to my lokesh senior.

this three persons have my gratitude towards them and i am more grateful to have them in my life.
