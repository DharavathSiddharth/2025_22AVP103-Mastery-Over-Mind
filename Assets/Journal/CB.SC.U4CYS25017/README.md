SCENARIO 1
It was one of those humid September afternoons when everything-save for deadlines-seemed to drag by in slow motion. The 3 o'clock deadline for my Psychology Internal Assessment ticked ominously on, and fate seemed to be working against me. Right in the middle of compiling the final report, the laptop had burned out. I sat transfixed in front of the blank screen, a wave of panic welling up inside me. The cursor spun, taunting me. The classroom buzz reached my ears: those finishing submissions focused on capping off the final touches, each keystroke a sharp contrast to the heartbeat that was echoing in my ears. I could afford 40 minutes to still submit. I rebooted my laptop twice, watched it revive to the same frozen screen both times as my hands felt some tremors. Of course, I was not panicking because of the marks. It was the fear of disappointing myself-hours collecting the data, hours writing the analysis; to get so far and lose it, knowing it was not just a file to me but was effort and dedication, and most importantly, a little pride. That was when Sneha, some two rows behind me and generally the quiet sort, noticed that something was wrong. We had never talked further than the obligatory greetings. She walked up to me, leaned slightly, and murmured, "Everything okay?" I forced a smile that she could tell was fake. "Laptop's dead. Whole report's stuck. Deadline's in half an hour." She didn't say much, only put her laptop on my desk. "Just use mine. Log in, download your Google Docs, finish it." I floundered. "I can't your own work— She shook her head. "I submitted mine an hour ago. Go on." Speechless, for a moment. No more time for polite refusal, and so, with no more than an instinctive nod, I sat and began typing. My heart was back to thumping but this time for a different reason: someone else was standing in my corner. Sneha sat next to me, sipping calmly from her water bottle, formatting this document with me from time to time. Some hours afterward, she smiled and said, "Chill, twenty minutes to go; you'll make it." And I did. I submitted ad report at 2:58 PM, exactly two minutes before the portal was to close. When the ‘confirmation message’ finally appeared, I exhaled air that I didn’t even know I had been holding onto. And later, I kept thanking her, flustered and embarrassingly ad infinitum, but she found that funny, saying, "It's nothing. Everybody has them." But it should have been anything but "nothing." That evening, as I sat thinking over the whole matter in the hostel common room, I thought: Sneha and I were not even friends. I knew very little about her except that she did a lot of doodling in the margins of her notebooks and always had a flask of coffee with her. Yet, she rose to the occasion when nobody else even looked. There is something very humbling about that — the fact that help may come from the most unexpected places, that sometimes people really don't owe us anything, but they choose to be kind regardless. I went the very next day, leaving a thank-you note on her desk with a chocolate bar. Later, she came to me and told me, "You really didn't have to do that." I smiled, "Neither did you, but you went ahead and did." From that week on, we were fast friends and partners in crime, or rather, study partners. Sneha had a still strength, the kind that didn't have to call attention to itself or seek validation from others; she helped out of some innate sense that it was just right to do so. Watching her taught me a lesson that I never learned in any lecture: real gratitude is not just saying thank you; it is to learn from the act of kindness. As time went on, I started to notice the other Snehas around me: classmates sharing notes, lab partners who stayed late to help out, hostel mates who shared snacks during those late, stressful nights. These small acts, hidden from view by the incessant hubbub of an active life, bind a community together. That experience changed how I began interacting with people. I started asking classmates if help was needed before submissions not because I expected anything in return, but because I knew how big of a lifeline that seemed like a small act could be. Gratitude became this never-ending cycle; once I received it, I was more willing to share it. On and off, whenever Sneha and I meet in the library, we laugh over "the Great Laptop Crisis of September." But deep inside, I know that such a moment is not just comic relief. It symbolizes how, calm in the storm, one can aid in another's survival. I now know gratitude is not instilled in grandfathers but grows quietly in these small, unplanned moments when kindness meets vulnerability. I'm grateful for that day's technical failure. If my laptop hadn't frozen that day, I might never have spoken properly to Sneha. Sometimes, gratitude disguises itself behind chaos, waiting for you to look past frustration and see that helpful hand held out for you. That day taught me the simplest truth: help often comes disguised as coincidence, but it is compassion, and it is alive. And gratitude is not about remembering the thanks to people; it is about remembering how they made you feel when you needed them the most.

SCENARIO 2
Today, I would like to thank one of the greatest motivating teachers I have ever had, Professor Amit Agarwal Sir. Whenever I think of those who made a real difference in my journey of academics and personal growth, his name comes first. From the very first day I attended his class, I sensed something different about the way he approached teaching. It wasn’t just about finishing the syllabus or making us memorize formulas and definitions — it was about making us understand, question, and connect what we were learning to the real world.The one thing that amazes me most about Amit Agarwal Sir is his patience. He never makes students feel small for not knowing something. No matter how many times someone asks the same question, he listens carefully, explains it again with a smile, and makes sure that everyone understands before moving on. This quality itself has brought a great change in the way I approach learning. In many classes, students often don't raise their hands because they fear being judged or scolded. But in his class, that fear disappears. 

He builds a space where curiosity is celebrated and mistakes are seen as a part of learning.There are several moments that really proved him to be a special teacher. I recall this one time when I was stuck with a complex concept and thought that it was just too hard to comprehend. I'd read the book, done videos online, but whatever I tried, absolutely nothing made sense. During one of his lectures, I asked him about it, expecting just a brief answer. Instead, he paused the lesson for a moment, went to the board, and explained the whole concept in a completely new way — using simple examples and everyday analogies. Suddenly, everything clicked. I can still recall that feeling of clarity and relief when I finally understood. From that day on, I knew that this was it: great teachers don't just deliver information; they transform how you think and learn.Another thing that I really admire about Sir is his love for the subject. You can see the spark in his eyes when he teaches. It's contagious; it makes students excited about learning, even about things that may initially appear to be boring. He often relates lessons in the classroom to real-life applications, making the content come alive. Every time he shares stories about the discovery, experiments, or people behind certain scientific ideas, it reminds me that learning is not just about passing exams, but it's about understanding the world and finding inspiration in knowledge.What sets Amit Agarwal Sir apart is not just his brilliance as a teacher but also his humanity towards the students.

I have seen him encouraging certain students who were shy or struggling by instilling confidence in them to speak up or try again. His words are always so thoughtful and reach a motivational chord. He often tells us that everyone learns at their own pace and that effort counts more than immediate success. This message stayed with me through tough times. Whenever I face difficulties, I remind myself of his advice: “Never stop being curious, and never give up just because something seems hard.”His influence extends far beyond the classroom: he has taught me valuable lessons on patience, humility, and dedication. It really is a sight to see him put such care into preparing lessons, stay behind after every class to help students, and remain so enthusiastic year in and year out. It shows how much he cares about what he does and how deeply he believes in the power of education. In a world where many people rush through their work, seeing someone who gives so much of himself to teaching is rare and beautiful. also appreciate how approachable he is. Many professors seem distant or unapproachable, but Sir is always there when we need guidance. Whether it’s academic advice or personal encouragement, he listens with genuine interest. There was one time when I felt overpowered with assignments piling up and began to doubt my abilities. The moment he noticed that I wasn’t participating as much in class, quietly after the lecture, he called out to me. He didn’t scold or question me but instead asked if everything was okay. We talked for a while, and his words helped me regain my focus and confidence. That small gesture meant a lot to me. It reminded me that great teachers don’t just teach subjects; they nurture people.Over time, I have come to realize that what I learned most from Amit Agarwal Sir is not about academics; rather, it is a particular way of approaching learning and life. He says many times that the day you take off the pressure of grades and enjoy the process of discovery, that is actually when real learning starts. That perspective changed how I think about my studies. Now, even if I struggle with a topic, instead of frustration, I at least try to stay curious. I have learned to ask questions, explore multiple viewpoints, and see failure as an opportunity for improvement.Sir's influence has also made me a better person outside of academics. His humility despite his expertise reminds me that knowledge and kindness must go hand in hand. He once shared with us that he still considers himself a student, always learning from his experiences and from others. That statement really moved me. It showed me that no matter how much you achieve, there’s always room to grow.

I can now look back at my journey and find how much he shaped my attitude and confidence. His encouragement made me take part in class discussions, execute projects that earlier seemed to be difficult, and trust my abilities. His belief in his students has a powerful effect-it makes us want to prove ourselves worthy of that kind of trust. If I had to describe Amit Agarwal Sir in a few words, I'd say he's not just a teacher; he's a mentor, a guide, an inspiration. His classroom is more than a place to study; it's a space where ideas grow, where learning feels meaningful, and where every student feels valued. Every time I walk out of his class, I feel a little more confident, a little more curious, and a lot more motivated to do my best. It’s easy to let appreciation slide by in today’s fast-paced world. Writing down this entry of my gratitude journal made me feel grateful for every moment when I have a teacher like Amit Agarwal Sir. His passion for teaching and patience with all his students and an interest in lifelong learning continue to inspire me day after day. One day, when I will look at my college years, I will remember not just the grades earned but the values and lessons learned from him — lessons about perseverance, curiosity, and kindness. Thank you, Sir, for everything: for your time, your wisdom, and your unfailing support. You have not only taught me academics but helped me grow as a person. I'll always be grateful for your guidance, and I'll carry your lessons with me wherever life takes me.

SCENARIO 3
Date: from the college days
Whom:cleaning staff who clean our corridor and bathrooms
When I sit and think about the people who make our everyday college life easier, the first people that come to my mind are not the teachers or friends, but the cleaning staff who clean our corridors and bathrooms every day. They are the ones who make sure our surroundings are fresh and comfortable. Most of us don’t even notice them properly, but they quietly do their work every single day without expecting any praise. I feel really thankful and grateful for all their effort.Every morning, when I walk out of my room, I see them already at work. It’s still early, and many students are asleep, but the cleaning staff have already started sweeping the floors, washing the bathrooms, and mopping the corridors. It’s not easy work, yet they do it so patiently. Because of them, our college looks neat and feels nice to live in. If they weren’t there, we would probably have to walk in dirty corridors and use unclean bathrooms. Just thinking about that makes me realize how important they are for us.Sometimes I wonder if we really appreciate them enough. We see them daily, but how many of us actually stop to say thank you? Most of us just walk past them without thinking. But the truth is, they play a big part in our daily comfort. We get to start our day in a clean environment because they finish their tiring work before we even begin ours. That’s something I respect a lot.I still remember one day during the rainy season — the whole corridor was muddy because everyone came in with wet shoes. It looked really messy, and I thought it would take the whole day to clean. But within a short time, the cleaning staff came and mopped everything perfectly. They kept doing it even though the floor kept getting dirty again and again. I was honestly amazed at their patience. They didn’t complain or get angry; they just quietly did their job. That day I truly realized how hardworking they are.Because of their work, we get to live and study in a clean environment. And that matters more than we realize. A clean place makes us feel calm and fresh. Our mood depends a lot on how our surroundings look and smell. When the bathrooms are clean and the corridor is fresh, it automatically makes us feel better. On the other hand, when a place is dirty, we feel irritated and tired. So in a way, the cleaning staff also help us mentally — by giving us a pleasant and positive space to live in.Their job is not easy. Cleaning bathrooms, wiping floors, carrying buckets of water — it’s all physically tiring. But they do it every single day with dedication. Sometimes I notice how they talk to each other while working, smiling and joking. Even though their work is tough, they still manage to stay cheerful. That really inspires me. It shows me that if you do your work with a good heart, even hard work feels lighter.Another thing I’ve noticed is how humble they are. They greet students politely and never show any frustration even when people make their work harder. There are times when some students don’t bother to keep things tidy, but the cleaning staff still handle it calmly. They clean everything again and again, making sure others don’t face discomfort. That kind of patience is not something everyone has.

I try to greet them whenever I see them, just a small “Good morning” or “Thank you.” It might seem like a small thing, but I feel it makes a difference. One day, I said thank you to one of the cleaning ladies after she finished mopping near my room. She smiled so warmly and said, “It’s okay, son, it’s my duty.” But I could see that she was happy that someone noticed her work. That smile stayed in my mind for a long time. It reminded me that appreciation, even a small one, means a lot.What I’ve learned from them is that no work is small or big. Every job has value. They don’t wear formal clothes or teach in classrooms, but they teach us something more important through their actions — the value of hard work and humility. They remind us that real dignity lies in doing your duty sincerely, no matter what kind of work it is.Sometimes, when I walk in a clean corridor or use a tidy bathroom, I try to remind myself that it didn’t just become clean by itself. Someone woke up early, worked hard, and made sure it looked that way. It’s so easy for us to take that for granted, but without them, college life would be very uncomfortable.They may not get awards or attention, but in reality, their role is just as important as anyone else’s. Without cleanliness, the college would not run properly. Even our health depends on the environment being clean. Because of their efforts, we are safe from infections and diseases. They protect us silently in their own way.I’ve also noticed how they care for their workspaces. Sometimes they talk about keeping the washrooms smelling fresh or using less water when cleaning. It shows how much pride they take in their work. They don’t just clean; they care. That’s something I really admire.I feel we should learn to respect them more. Just because someone’s job looks simple doesn’t mean it’s easy. They deserve appreciation, respect, and kindness from all of us. A simple smile or word of thanks can make them feel seen and valued.Whenever I feel lazy to clean my own room, I remember how they work for hours every day without complaint. It motivates me to be more responsible about my own surroundings. They have unknowingly taught me to keep things neat and organized.To me, the cleaning staff are like silent heroes of our college. They don’t seek attention, but their work keeps everything functioning smoothly. Because of them, we live in a clean and pleasant environment. Because of them, our mornings start fresh. Because of them, we don’t have to worry about hygiene. They make sure we don’t suffer, and they do it all quietly, with patience and kindness.I am truly thankful to them for everything they do. They make our college not just clean but also comfortable and welcoming. Their hard work, dedication, and kindness inspire me to be more humble and grateful in life.comfortable and welcoming.  Whenever I think of gratitude, I realize it’s not only for big things or big people. It’s also for those who do small things with big hearts. And for me, the cleaning staff in our college are a perfect example of that. They remind me every day that good work doesn’t always need recognition it just needs sincerity.So, from the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you to them — for their hard work, for their patience, and for making our surroundings clean and peaceful. They make our days better without even knowing it, and I will always be grateful to them for that.
