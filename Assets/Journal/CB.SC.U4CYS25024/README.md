The three incidents that happened which i really grateful am for are..

Near start of august..
At the beginning of our college days like some of my friends I too was nervous about college. New environment , new faces and all that stuff obviously did not help. The first 2 days went kind of okayish thanks very much to my friends. But it also kind of made me wonder
how these 4 years would go by especaially on our first day on bus. But fortunately thats where I met Saubarnika. She was studying ECE in our college which was the course I had wanted to do but unfortunately couldnt. She was kind to tell me everything about college and other things . Since she also studied in the same school as me (which I toatally didnt expect) we became really close. I think she was the first ever friend I got in college here. From then on we sat next to each other. She has a really nice and positive attitude towards everything in life which was really admirable. It was only after meeting her that I kindof became convinced that I would meet my people here..
But also I'd like to tell that she and I are no longer sitting next to eachother due to not enough seatings being available on the bus..But still thanks to that one senior who kindof helped me put a smile on my face for the whole day..

Near mid august..
The teacher who kindof inspired me a lot was our Principles of Engineering proffessor Amit Agarwal. What made me to be inspired by him was his way of teaching. His way of teaching was really carefree which forced us to search for the syllabus ourselves which proved really grateful as it made us understand the concepts ourselves. I think in my opinion that it is the best way to learn things because that way the things we learn would be way more interesting. Because I am a person who is genuinely interested to find how things work ,to see behind the screen. So naturally I think when you learn things by yourselves it gives you sense of accomplishment and meaningfullness which IS unmatchable! I mean things SHOULD be learnt that way . He gives and shares enough knowledge about things which keeps us hooked on as well as make us search for the rest that is a one of a kind way of teaching and I really appreciate that. This simple thing can make such a big difference. Especially during our preparations for our mid semester I just got to realize how much mind blowing this is. Being a person who hates just the current related stuff about physics it made fall in love with that too. And this also made me realize that his style can not just be considered as a way of teaching but you can also apply it in your life and in relationships too..

At the starting of august..
Finally..
Of course just like everybody else the people who i found really really fortunately..
Who dearly are Ridhanya,Tejashree,Kavya,Shivani,Anushree. They were really supportive and gave me confidence when i needed it. I really am grateful for them because without them I clearly have no idea I would have survived the first week of college till date . All these creatures have a totally different characters. It really is true that without friends you really cant be happy. I really am grateful and thankful that I have found them within this semester. As none of my school friends had joined here I was truely worried that would I find my people . But I was really lucky that I found them . There is something in thees guys's care whenever I feel down and their habit of including everyone , sharing even a small cup of tea and laughing on our small inside jokes. Never did I expect that I'll meet such people with whom you can talk all sensitive things one moment and then laugh on brain rot jokes on another. There is a level of uncomfortness in going to a new place regularly where u spend 90% of the time in there and the rest 10% getting ready to go there. But with these people it doesnt feel like a new place at all . In fact it feels like my second home where I can both be unbothered and bothered at the same time.
The word gratefullness is obviously no match for the thing I feel towards them!!


Also I really feel appreciated for this great oppurtunity i got to share what I found inspiring and grateful..really thanking you sir..
