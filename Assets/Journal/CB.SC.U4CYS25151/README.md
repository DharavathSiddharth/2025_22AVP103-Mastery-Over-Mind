## Journal Record
GRATITUDE JOURNAL
   SCENARIO 1 :(11-08-25)
When I think about the people who’ve made my college experience special so far, the first names that come to mind are Bhavishya and Deepthi. I met them on the fourth day of college, and I’m honestly so thankful for that. It’s strange how quickly we became close — as if we were meant to meet. In the beginning, everything felt new and confusing. The first few days of college were filled with uncertainty, awkward introductions, and a lot of trying to figure things out. But once I met them, things slowly started to make sense.

They made everything feel lighter. From helping me find my way around campus to simply being there when I needed someone to talk to, they turned those overwhelming first days into memories I now look back on fondly. Whenever I feel low or anxious, they are the ones who make sure I’m not alone. They listen, comfort me, and make me laugh even on the most tiring days. Having people who genuinely care and look out for you makes such a huge difference, especially when you’re far from familiar faces.

What I appreciate most about Bhavishya and Deepthi is how real they are. There’s never any pretence between us — we can just be ourselves. Whether it’s sharing random thoughts during lunch breaks, walking together to classes, or sitting quietly when we’re too tired to talk, everything feels comfortable and natural. They’ve shown me that friendships don’t always take years to form; sometimes, the right people just click instantly. I truly feel lucky that I found them so early in my college journey.

Apart from them, I’ve also met some wonderful people who have made my days brighter — Maneesha, Nethra, Amirtha, Harshitha, Mansi, Sreekanth, Advik, Aadi, and Midhun Cheta. Each of them brings something unique to our group. Whether it’s someone’s sense of humour, another’s kindness, or their small gestures of care, they all contribute in their own way to making university life memorable.

Being surrounded by people like them makes every day a little more enjoyable. We’ve already shared so many small yet meaningful moments — laughing over inside jokes, getting lost on campus, working together on assignments, or just sitting and talking for hours. These little things might seem simple, but they’re what make this phase of life special.

I’ve learned that college isn’t just about classes and deadlines. It’s about the people you meet and the connections you build. I’m grateful that I’ve found a group of friends who make me feel seen, supported, and understood. Whenever I think about how nervous I was on my first day, I can’t help but smile at how far things have come.

This journey is still just beginning, and I know there will be ups and downs ahead. But knowing that I have people like Bhavishya, Deepthi, and the rest of my friends by my side makes me feel more confident about facing whatever comes next. They’ve turned an unfamiliar place into something that feels a little like home — and that’s something I’ll always be grateful for.
SCENARIO 2 :(8-08-25)
When I think about the people who make my college life feel comfortable and homely, the first ones that come to my mind are my roommates — Navya, Hema, and Dithy. Living in a hostel or dorm can be tricky sometimes, especially when you’re new to everything, but I’ve been really lucky with the people I share my space with. They’ve made our room more than just a place to sleep; it feels like our own little world.

Each one of them brings something different to our room. Navya is the calm and studious one. She’s always focused, yet never makes anyone feel pressured about it. She has this peaceful way of doing things — whether it’s studying, arranging her books, or just quietly sitting and scrolling through her phone. Talking to her always feels easy; she listens and understands without judging. And one of my favourite things about her is how she shares her food so naturally. There’s never any hesitation — she just offers it like it’s the most normal thing in the world. It’s a small thing, but it says so much about her kindness and the comfort we share.

Then there’s Hema, who is completely different from Navya but equally special in her own way. She’s a little crazy — the fun, spontaneous type who can make anyone laugh. She has this pure-hearted, cheerful energy that fills the room. Even when she does something silly, it just adds to her charm. But one thing that we’ll never forget about Hema is her alarm. It’s the one sound that all of us both fear and laugh about. Every morning, her alarm goes off like a mini explosion, and none of us can ever ignore it. Even if we try to go back to sleep, it’s impossible. But over time, it’s become something we joke about almost every day. Whenever it rings, we all groan, tease her, and laugh endlessly — and somehow, that alarm has become part of our morning routine. It’s funny how even something annoying can turn into a memory that feels special.

And then there’s Dithy, the pretty little baby of our room. That’s what we call her — not because she’s younger, but because she just gives off that soft, sweet vibe that makes everyone want to protect her. She’s adorable, caring, and always adds a spark of positivity to our days. We often sit together and watch reels, laughing at the most random videos and sending each other memes even when we’re just a few feet apart. When she’s free, she teaches me Malayalam, and those moments always make me happy. I struggle to pronounce the words correctly, and she laughs, corrects me gently, and patiently teaches me again. Those small interactions might seem simple, but they’ve helped us bond deeply.

Together, the four of us make a good balance — calmness from Navya, energy from Hema, sweetness from Dithy, and a bit of everything from me. We share food, talk for hours, complain about classes, laugh at silly things, and sometimes just sit quietly doing our own stuff while still feeling connected. We haven’t had misunderstandings, which honestly feels rare. I think it’s because we respect each other’s space and understand when someone needs quiet time or when someone needs company.

Our room always feels alive — whether it’s because of the music playing softly in the background, the sound of laughter, or Hema’s alarm ringing for the fifth time. There’s a sense of warmth that makes it feel like home. At the end of a long or tiring day, coming back to this space and these people feels comforting.

I’m really grateful for Navya, Hema, and Dithy — for their kindness, their quirks, and for making our room such a happy, peaceful place to be. They’ve turned an ordinary hostel room into a space full of laughter, care, and memories that I’ll carry with me long after college.
SCENARIO 3:(2-10-25)
When I think about the people who have made my college life easier and more meaningful, my seniors come to mind immediately. I met them in October, a little after the semester had started. By that time, I had already settled into a routine, but I was still figuring things out — especially with academics and how to handle everything smoothly. Meeting them was something that happened unexpectedly, but it turned out to be one of the best things that could have happened.

At first, I didn’t know them well. They were just familiar faces I had seen around. But once we started talking, everything felt easy. They were friendly and approachable from the beginning. Slowly, our casual conversations turned into real guidance and support. I realized how kind and understanding they were, always willing to help without expecting anything in return.

I’ve always struggled a little with math, and during those times, they’ve helped me patiently. Whenever I couldn’t solve a question or got stuck, they never made me feel embarrassed for not knowing. Instead, they took the time to explain everything step by step until I understood. The way they broke down problems made even the toughest concepts seem simple. I truly admire their patience and the calm way they teach — it’s something that motivates me to be the same with others someday.

Apart from helping with studies, they’ve supported me in many other ways too. There have been moments when I felt stressed about exams or assignments, and they were always there with the right words to calm me down. They’d remind me that college isn’t just about marks, that it’s okay to take things one step at a time. They’ve shared their own experiences — the mistakes they made, the lessons they learned — so that I wouldn’t repeat them. Every story or piece of advice they give feels genuine and comes from experience. Listening to them makes me feel more confident about facing challenges here.

One of the things that really shows how thoughtful they are happened recently — I had forgotten to take the Gemini Pro subscription, which I needed for some work. Without even thinking twice, they offered me their account so I could continue using it. It might sound like a small thing, but to me, it meant a lot. That gesture showed how generous and kind-hearted they are. Not everyone would do something like that, and it’s one of those little things that I’ll always remember with gratitude.

Beyond academics and help, what I value most is how genuine they are as people. They don’t just give advice — they actually listen. They understand what it’s like to be new, to feel lost or unsure at times. They’ve made college feel less intimidating and more manageable. Whenever I’m unsure about how to handle a situation or feel like I’m falling behind, I know I can reach out to them. Even when they’re busy, they somehow find time to check in and encourage me.

Looking back, I’m really thankful that I met them in October. Even though it’s been only a few months, their presence has made a huge difference. They’ve helped me grow, both academically and personally. I’ve learned from them not just how to study better, but also how to stay calm, positive, and kind.
