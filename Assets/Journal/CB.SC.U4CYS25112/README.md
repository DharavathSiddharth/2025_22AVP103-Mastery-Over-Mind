## Journal Record
1) to maths sir :
 Gratitude Journal – To My Maths Sir

Today, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my Maths sir, whose teaching has truly made a difference in my learning journey. His classes are not just about solving equations or memorizing formulas, but about understanding the deeper connection between mathematics and the real world. Every time he teaches a new concept, he relates it to practical applications and even connects it with future technologies, which makes the subject far more interesting and meaningful.

One thing that stands out about him is his ability to make even the toughest topics seem simple. He patiently explains every step, ensuring that no one is left confused. Whenever we have doubts, he never hesitates to clarify them immediately, no matter how small or repetitive the question might be. This instant support gives us confidence and helps us stay motivated to learn more.

What I really admire is his friendly and approachable nature. He never makes the classroom feel strict or stressful. Instead, he creates a comfortable and encouraging environment where we can freely express our thoughts and ask questions without fear. His positive attitude and supportive approach make learning maths a truly enjoyable experience.

Beyond academics, he also inspires us to think about how mathematics shapes the future — from technology and data to innovation and problem-solving. His passion for teaching and his vision for the future have motivated me to see mathematics not just as a subject, but as a powerful tool that builds the world around us.


2)to POE sir :
oday, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my POE sir. His way of teaching has truly helped me understand the practical side of circuits and connections. Before his classes, I used to think that circuits were only about theory and formulas. But after learning from him, I started to see how everything we study actually works in real life.

Sir always makes the subject interesting by giving real-life examples. Whenever he teaches a new topic, he relates it to how we use it in daily life or in real engineering projects. For example, when he explains about sensors or connections, he shows how they are used in machines or devices that we use every day. This makes the topic easier to understand and more meaningful.

What I really like is how he teaches us to think logically and practically. He always says that understanding the concept is more important than memorizing. His classes are never boring — he keeps them interactive by asking questions, encouraging us to share our thoughts, and helping us find answers ourselves.

I also enjoy the lab sessions a lot because of him. Working with the equipment, connecting wires, and testing circuits make me feel like a real engineer. I remember thanking him after our second lab session after the Dasara holidays because that day I realized how much I was enjoying learning this subject.

He is also very supportive and patient. Whenever we have doubts or make mistakes, he guides us calmly and helps us correct them. His encouragement gives me confidence to try new things and learn without fear.

Once again, I sincerely thank my POE sir for being such a wonderful teacher. His teaching has not only improved my knowledge but also increased my curiosity to explore more in the field of electronics. I truly appreciate his effort, kindness, and passion for teaching.


3)to english mam:
 Today, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to my English ma’am. Her teaching has really helped me improve my communication skills and boosted my confidence in speaking. Before attending her classes, I was not very comfortable speaking in front of others. I often worried about making mistakes in grammar or pronunciation. But her way of teaching made me feel more confident and interested in learning English.

There was one time when I had to give a speech in class, and I got stuck in the middle. I felt nervous and thought I had failed. But instead of scolding me or ignoring it, ma’am smiled and motivated me. She told me not to give up and said that everyone learns by trying again. She gave me another chance to speak, and that time, I felt more confident and did much better. That moment made me realize how kind and supportive she is.

She always encourages us to express ourselves freely and not be afraid of making mistakes. Her way of teaching is very calm, friendly, and easy to understand. She explains every grammar rule clearly and gives examples that are simple to remember. Because of her, I started to enjoy learning grammar and using new words in my daily conversations.

I still remember thanking her in the language lab before our internal exams. I told her how much she had helped me in improving my speaking and writing skills. She was very happy and told me to keep practicing and never stop learning. Her kind words gave me more motivation to work harder.
