Subject: three people im grateful for 
1. deepak, im very grateful  for meeting deepak I met him on the first day (6/8/2025) of my B tech journey,he seemed a little angry type of  person but later I got to know I was wrong, he is very innocent and a good person. He always handles every situation with a smile on his face. He never complains about any problem he always finds a solution or atleast tries to solve the problem. He is one of our fellow classmates and also my roommate.He is very generous and has a lot of experience in maintaining and living in hostel,as he stayed in the hostel before. He gave me some advises and best practices for staying in hostels.On the day of certificate verification (10/8/2025) there was a problem , I had all the certificate originals but not the xerox ones I panicked a lot but deepak  told me not to panic, he showed me the way to xerox shop and helped me getting all the xerox copies done im very grateful for deepak for his act because , that day im new to college i dont know anything and the certificate authority people are waiting for me to get the xerox copies done, only deepak helped me out.deepak always tries to make me laugh whenever i'm sad . Im very grateful to him throughout this journey.
2. Sreejith sir, I'm very grateful for meeting sreejith sir..he is our class advisor, at first I have many doubts regarding this college and course that I have selected but Sreejith sir helped me out of that confusion and he guided me . He told me how to score marks and also do's and dont's . He told me that the course I have selected is the best course , I felt happy that  I made a good decision choosing this course, and he also motivated me a lot. Sreejith sir helped me in applying for the home pass as I dont know how to apply for one, He stopped all his work and helped me resolve a small problem (applying for a homepass) .He always cares for his students no matter how complex the peoblem is ...he always gives advises and tries to solve the problem . I will always be grateful for sreejith sir ,he is the best class advisor I have ever seen and he is a great teacher .  He even explains silly doubts and share ppts . Ill remember sreejith sir throughout my journey
