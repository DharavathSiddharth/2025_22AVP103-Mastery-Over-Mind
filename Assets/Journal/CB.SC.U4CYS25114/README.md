# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
Scenario 1 – To: Anjana (Date: 17/10/2025)

The day before my Modern Physics mid-semester test was one of the most stressful days I can remember. I was really tense because I didn’t understand the last chapter properly. I had tried reading it many times, but the concepts just wouldn’t make sense. I felt lost and scared that I would lose all my marks in that part of the test.

That’s when my hostel-mate Anjana came to help me. She noticed how worried I was and immediately offered to teach me. Even though she had her own studies to do, she sat with me patiently and explained the entire chapter from the beginning. She didn’t rush or get irritated. Instead, she broke down the difficult topics into simple parts and gave me examples that made everything much easier to understand.

That evening turned out to be really special. We sat on my bed with books and notes spread out everywhere, and she kept explaining until I finally understood the chapter. Her patience and kindness really touched me. She didn’t just help me with studies — she helped me calm down and believe that I could actually do well.

The next day, right before entering the exam hall, Anjana again made sure I remembered all the key points and formulas. She quickly revised the important questions with me and gave me confidence. When I finally sat for the exam, I was surprised to see questions from the same chapter I had been scared of — but this time, I was ready. I answered everything correctly, and it felt so good.

Looking back, I realize that Anjana’s help meant much more than just academic support. She gave me confidence when I had none. She reminded me that real friends are those who stand by us when we’re struggling. Without her, I might have failed that part of the test, but more importantly, I might have lost faith in myself.

I’ll always be grateful to her — not just for teaching me that chapter, but for being kind, patient, and supportive when I needed it the most.

Scenario 2 – To: Sathvika, Hema, and Navya (Date: 08/10/2025)

Being sick away from home is one of the hardest things I’ve gone through. I remember the week when I had a high fever and was stuck in my hostel room. I felt weak, homesick, and worried about the upcoming exams. Everything seemed dull and stressful. But during that time, my roommates — Sathvika, Hema, and Navya — made sure I was never alone or sad.

They were like my family in the hostel. Sathvika noticed I wasn’t feeling well first and immediately brought me warm water and medicine. Soon, Hema and Navya joined in and took care of me the entire day. They helped me eat, made sure I took rest, and checked my temperature every few hours. Their kindness made me feel safe and cared for, just like I was at home.

Even though they had their own exams to prepare for, they made time to cheer me up. They told jokes, played games, and made me laugh when I was feeling low. Sathvika, especially, kept the room lively with her energy and funny stories. She would make me laugh so much that I’d forget I was sick. Hema was quiet but very caring — she would check if I was comfortable and keep things ready for me without saying much. Navya kept me motivated, telling me that I would recover soon and that we would all study together later.

Those few days made me realize how lucky I was to have such amazing friends. Their care helped me recover faster, and their love made me forget my homesickness. Our room felt like a second home filled with laughter, support, and warmth.

After I got better, I thought a lot about how they had taken care of me without expecting anything in return. It showed me what true friendship really means — being there for someone when they need it the most. They reminded me that friendship isn’t just about having fun together, but also about standing by each other through tough times.

I’ll always be thankful to Sathvika, Hema, and Navya for looking after me like sisters. Their love and care turned one of my worst weeks into one of the most comforting experiences of my life.

Scenario 3 – To: Research Student (Date: 17/09/2025)

One day in our Principles of Electronics (POE) lab, my teammates and I had a very frustrating experience. We were supposed to build a circuit and observe the output on the display, but no matter what we did, the output just wouldn’t show. We checked our connections again and again, reattached wires, and even restarted the system, but nothing worked.

As time passed, we started to panic. Other teams had already finished their work while we were still stuck on the same step. We felt embarrassed and confused. We thought maybe we had done something wrong or misunderstood the experiment. The research student who helped us in the lab was busy with other groups, so we waited patiently until she came over.

When she finally checked our setup, she quickly noticed something strange. After testing a few things, she realized the machine itself was faulty. The problem wasn’t our circuit at all — the equipment wasn’t working properly. We had been trying to fix something that wasn’t even our fault. By then, the lab session was almost over, and we couldn’t complete the experiment. I felt disappointed and worried about losing marks.

But what happened next really touched me. After the lab ended, the research student called us aside and told us not to worry. After class, she took extra time to explain the experiment to us again. She patiently went through each connection, explained how the circuit was supposed to work, and cleared all our doubts. She didn’t rush or seem tired — instead, she genuinely wanted us to understand.

The next time we went to the lab, we tried the experiment again — and this time it worked perfectly. Seeing the correct output on the screen felt amazing. I realized that it was all because of the extra effort she had taken to help us.

Her kindness taught me that a good teacher doesn’t just teach during class hours — they care about whether their students truly understand. She could have easily left that day without helping us further, but she didn’t. That small act made a big difference.

That experience taught me to never lose confidence too quickly and to always stay patient when things go wrong. Most importantly, it reminded me how one person’s willingness to help can completely change someone else’s experience. I will always be grateful to her for going out of her way to teach us and for reminding me that kindness and patience can make learning much more meaningful.
