## Journal Record
Three persons i am grateful towards in Amrita University:
1.Ramaguru Sir(MaOM Faculty Member)
2.Priya (My senior)
3.Hemachandra (B.tech junior CSE core student)
1 -- On 28th of October 2025, Ramaguru sir came to our class and enquired our queries towards our PSAT faculty and her teaching.
He conveyed our problems to madam and he invested most of his valuable time towards this problem and figured out some solutions in order to make us understand the subject and solve our query. He suggested some of the advices to madam from his previous teaching experience to make children understand the subject.
2 -- On 17th October 2025, i was preparing for my physics mid term examination then i remembered that i am not having any calculator for the complex calculations in the examination. So i informed her about the situation then she came near my hostel gave me her calculator. With the help of her calculator i was able to calculate the complex calculations in exam. She helped me at that peak time and  i am very grateful to her as she also helped in many situations in my early period in this college.
3 -- On 14th October 2025, I am feared towards my PSAT because i am not aware of flowgarithms topic in PSAT. Then he conveyed me his knowledge towards flowgarithms topic. So, I was somewhat able to write the answers for questions on the topic of flowgarithms. And he also helped me face many tough situations during examinations. So i am very grateful to him.

**Three People I'm Thankful for at Amrita**
1 -- Ramaguru Sir (MaOM Faculty Member)
Ok so Ramaguru Sir. Where I even start with this guy.

On October 28, 2025. We all were losing our mind over PSAT. Like genuinely stressed yaar. The concepts weren't clicking at all, half the class was confused as hell, and we all just kind of suffering in silence. And then Sir just... came to our classroom one day.

Not because he had to come. He is teaching us MaOM only, not PSAT. But he came anyway.

You could see it on his face - he was looking worried. Not in scary way, more like he actually gave a damn about how we're doing. He pulled one chair and was like "tell me what's going on, what's confusing you people?" And we just started talking. Complaining, really. But he didn't cut us off or check his phone or anything. He literally just sit there and listened to us rant for like 20 minutes.

Here's the crazy part though - he didn't just listen and leave. He went straight to our PSAT instructor. I don't know exactly what he said but it must be good because within like two weeks everything changed. Classes got better, examples made more sense, we actually had time for asking questions. 

And Sir never mentioned it. Never. We just figured out later that he helped us behind the scenes.

That's when I realized - ok this is what good teachers actually do. They don't just lecture and disappear. They actually caring about you as a person, not just a grade in their attendance sheet. He showed me what real leadership looks like I guess. Listening when it matters, helping without making big deal about it.

I also just really liking his vibe?  And I'm asking LOT of dumb questions. 

 I still don't get it how he manages to be both strict and approachable at same time.

People like him are rare only. They make you realize education is not just about passing exams - it's about actually growing as person. Respect and all that.

That day wasn't just about fixing PSAT issues. It was bigger than that. Sometimes one person caring enough to do something can literally change everything na.

I'll remember that forever.
2 -- Priya (My senior in amrita university)

Priya is honestly lifesaver and I'm not saying lightly.

On October 17, 2025. Midterms time. I was preparing for Physics and completely panicking because - wait for it - I forgot my calculator. My CALCULATOR. For Physics exam. With like million numerical problems.

I'm sitting there at like 10pm just freaking out and I texted Priya. I wasn't even expecting she'll reply because hello, she's having her own exams no? But she replied immediately. "I'm coming over."

She literally grabbed her calculator and walked to my hostel. At 10pm. During midterms. And when she gave it to me she was smiling like this is the most normal thing ever. "You've got this," she told. And I don't know why but I instantly felt more calm.

I did pretty well in that exam. Every time I'm pressing button on that calculator I was like thank you Priya thank you Priya thank you Priya in my head.

But it's not even about the calculator really. It's about the fact that she just... helped. No questions asked. Didn't expect anything back. Just saw someone struggling and fixed it.

And this wasn't first time also! When I was confused mess of a freshman - completely lost, couldn't find any departments, didn't understood the timetable system - she walked me through EVERYTHING. Patiently. Checked on me later to make sure I'm ok. Made campus feel less scary.

What I love about Priya is she's so normal about helping people. Like she's not acting all superior or making you feel like you're bothering her even when you definitely are. She taught me that small acts of kindness - lending something, explaining something, just being there - can mean world to someone.

She's not just senior anymore. Mentor? Friend? Both probably.

Now whenever I'm stressed I literally asking myself "what Priya would do?" Usually the answer is something like - calm down, be nice, help however you can.

She showed me that being generous doesn't cost anything but it's like... really powerful? I'm so grateful. Not just for calculator thing but for being such genuinely good human.

3 -- Hemachandra (CSE Core junior student in amrita university)

And then there's Hemachandra who's technically my JUNIOR but honestly saved my ass so I'm putting him here.

October 14, 2025. PSAT exam is coming. Flowgorithm on the syllabus. Me? Absolutely clueless. I was sitting in my room staring at my notes like they're written in ancient Greek or something. Getting more stressed every minute.

Then Hemachandra messaged me out of nowhere. Like he just sensed I'm dying or something. I told him I'm struggling and he immediately offered to teach me. 

Over next few hours he broke EVERYTHING down. Algorithms, flowcharts, the logic - all of it. He drew diagrams, gave examples, kept checking "you understanding this part?" before moving forward. Super patient. No judgment at all for the fact that I'm struggling with basic stuff.

Exam day? I answered those questions confidently. All thanks to him only.

What gets me about Hemachandra is how humble he is. He's younger than me and could've easily been like "figure it out yourself senior" but he just helped like it's nothing. Never acted like he's doing me some massive favor. And he kept helping since then also - notes, clarifications, pep talks when I'm overwhelmed.

He's obviously smart but what really standing out is how kind he is. To him learning is like team sport not competition.

This changed how I think about asking for help honestly. Doesn't matter if someone is senior or junior or whatever. Help can come from anywhere. There's no hierarchy when it comes to kindness. Hemachandra made Amrita feel like actual community where people looking out for each other instead of just competing.

I'm grateful for academic stuff obviously but also for what he taught me about staying humble and remembering that education is as much about connections as it is about grades.

Maybe even more about connections actually.
When I'm thinking about these three people I just feel really lucky.

Ramaguru Sir, Priya, Hemachandra - they all showed me what empathy and generosity and humility actually looks like in real life. Not just as concepts but as actions. They shaped how I study but also who I'm becoming as person which sounds cheesy but it's true.

Gratitude is not just something you feel for second and forget. It's what connects you to good in people and reminds you why relationships actually matter.

These three people are everything I'm loving about being at Amrita. I'll always treasure what they given me.
