## Journal Record

I would like to express my heartful thanks and gratitude to the canteen staff. During hectic lunch hours, the canteen becomes an apocalypse of students rushing into the billing section to place their orders. Yet, the billing staffs and others in the canteen manage the crowd very well and make sure that  everyone's order gets delivered to them and no one's order get mismatched. The last month i was running late to my enlish class ad requested the canteen staff to bill my order up ahead of the queue and they did that for me due to which i was able to complete my lunch on time and reach my class on time top. So I thank them for the job they're doing, Thank you !!

Next I would like to thank Mr. Srinivasan, our maths lecturer. We all love his teaching and he breaks the content and teaches us in parts so that we understand every bit of the portion that he's taking. Last week when i had a very silly doubt to ask him, i was very hesitant to ask him but when i asked he didnt even turn me down and addressed the doubt of mine and made me clear with my concepts. So I would like to thank him !!

Lastly, I would like to thank my Class Advisor Mr. Praveen. Last month I had to get the Bonafide from the college administration for my address proof and though he had and was busy with his other works. He dedicated a bit of his time in between his busy schedule and he was not even in his cabin at that time and it was already 4:45 pm, yet he returned to his cabin just to respond to my query and responded too by which I got my Bonafide approved on time and I've completed my passport registration process on time. So I would like to express my gratitude to him. Thank you sir !!
