# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
Scenario 1
Time Period: 3 months ago
Whom: Arunima
When I first joined the campus, I was excited but also overwhelmed by how large and confusing everything seemed. The buildings looked similar, the pathways twisted in unexpected directions, and as a day scholar, every minute mattered because I needed to reach the entrance on time to catch the shuttle bus. With no prior familiarity with the campus layout, I naturally followed the route that everyone seemed to be taking. It was the longest pathway from AB3 to the entrance. Although it got me to where I needed to be, the walk was exhausting. It took nearly thirty minutes if I maintained a steady pace, and if I was even slightly late, I would end up missing the shuttle bus. On such days, I had no choice but to complete the entire long walk all the way to the entrance, carrying my backpack and worrying the entire time about getting late. This happened more often than I would like to admit, and every time it did, I would feel frustrated and drained before the day had even begun.

Being new to the campus meant every small task felt like a challenge. Unlike hostel students who lived within the campus and gradually discovered routes over time, I had very little flexibility. Time became a precious resource. I would keep checking my watch repeatedly while walking, wishing that the entrance would appear around the next corner. Instead, it always felt farther than I remembered. The long walk often caused me to arrive out of breath and tired, and by the time I got home in the evening, half my energy was already spent navigating the campus. I knew there had to be a shorter route, but I didn’t know whom to ask or where to look. So, for the first few days, I continued walking the same long path—hoping eventually I would figure it out.

Everything changed the day I had a conversation with my classmate, Arunima. During a casual conversation after class, I mentioned how exhausting the daily walk was. To my surprise, she immediately asked why I was taking such a long route. She then explained that there were shortcut pathways that could drastically reduce my walking distance and time. Until then, it had not occurred to me that shortcuts even existed. I was too used to following familiar paths to question whether there was an easier way.

Arunima did not just tell me about the shortcuts—she actually walked with me, showing me the route step by step. She pointed out landmarks along the way so that I would easily remember how to navigate it on my own. The first shortcut was from Garghi Bhavanam to the entrance. At first, it looked like an ordinary path I would have completely ignored if I was walking alone. It didn’t even cross my mind that such a narrow walkway could lead directly to the entrance. The second shortcut started from the turn after the Arjuna statue, eventually bringing us to AB1. From there, the entrance was only a few minutes away. With this route, I didn’t have to walk all the way around the buildings and long pavements; instead, I could cut directly through internal pathways, reducing almost half the walking time.

The first time I followed her through the shortcut, I could hardly believe how quickly we reached the entrance. What usually took me thirty minutes was completed in barely fifteen. It felt as though I had gained an extra fifteen minutes of life—every single day. From that moment onward, my routine changed drastically. I was no longer anxious about missing the shuttle bus. I didn’t need to rush or walk hurriedly. I had time to slow down, breathe, and enjoy the surroundings instead of constantly worrying about how long the path was. I even noticed things I had never paid attention to before—trees, buildings, small gardens along the way—simply because I wasn’t in a panic to reach the gate anymore.

This seemingly small act of kindness from Arunima made a big difference in my everyday life. For me, it was not just about finding a shorter route. It was about feeling supported and welcomed at a time when everything felt unfamiliar. In a new environment, even tiny gestures can have a huge impact, and for me, this was one of those moments. I had been silently struggling with something as simple as a walking path, and without being asked, she stepped in to make things easier.

What I admire most is that Arunima did not treat it as a big favor. To her, it was as simple as sharing information that she already knew. But to me, it was a gesture that saved time, energy, and stress every day. It reminded me that sometimes, help arrives in the smallest and most unexpected forms—through a conversation, a suggestion, or a shortcut we did not know existed. Her willingness to guide me showed me that one person’s familiarity and experience can help another person feel more confident.

Today, I confidently walk through these shortcuts on my own. I no longer worry about running to the entrance or missing the shuttle bus. Instead of feeling like a lost newcomer, I now feel like I belong on the campus. Every time I walk those pathways, I am reminded of how a simple act of kindness changed my daily routine and improved my campus experience. And every time I see someone struggling to navigate, I feel motivated to help them just as Arunima helped me.

In the end, this experience taught me something valuable—that guidance, no matter how small, can make a big difference in someone’s life. I am truly grateful to Arunima for showing me those shortcuts, not just to the entrance, but also toward feeling comfortable and at home on campus.

Scenario 2
Time Period: 3.5 months ago 
Whom: Cleaning Staff
Gratitude is often expressed for grand gestures—acts that are visible, celebrated, and easily noticed. However, some of the most meaningful contributions come from people whose work takes place quietly and consistently in the background. They don’t stand in the spotlight, yet their effort impacts us every single day. One such group is the cleaning staff on our campus. Their work ensures that our classrooms and hallways remain neat, organized, and pleasant to be in. We walk into these well-maintained spaces and immediately begin our day, often forgetting that someone else arrived much earlier to make sure everything looked ready for us. Today, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to them—especially for taking such good care of our classroom and keeping the boards and surroundings spotless.

Every week when I enter my classroom, I notice how clean everything looks—the desks are arranged neatly, the floor is swept, and the whiteboard or chalkboard looks fresh and ready for use. But what truly stands out is the way the board looks. In our classroom, the board is used for multiple purposes throughout the week: professors write notes, diagrams are sketched, reminders are scribbled on one corner, and sometimes students use it for group discussions or presentations. By the end of the week, the board usually becomes extremely dusty. Chalk dust settles into every corner, faint lines and smudges overlap, and the board develops a dull, cloudy appearance. At that point, even writing something new on it becomes difficult because the fresh writing gets mixed with old marks, and nothing is clearly visible.

During my first week, the situation was particularly challenging. The board was covered with layers of chalk dust from various lectures. The writings on the board looked faded, unclear, and almost unreadable. I remember entering the classroom, looking at the board, and thinking to myself, “How are we supposed to learn anything from this? How will the professor write on top of this dusty surface?” When the class began, reading the content on the board felt like solving a puzzle. We had to strain our eyes to make out the words, and diagrams became confusing due to overlapping dust marks. It was frustrating—not because anyone was at fault, but because the board simply hadn’t been cleaned.

After that class, I noticed one of the cleaning staff members near our block. I hesitated for a moment, wondering if I should say something. I didn’t want to sound demanding or ungrateful. But finally, I approached them and politely explained the issue. I told them that the board becomes very dusty by the end of the week and asked if it could be cleaned more regularly. The staff member listened patiently and smiled. They assured me gently, “Don’t worry, we will clean it.” It was a simple sentence, but it carried sincerity and willingness.

What happened afterward truly impressed me.

From the very next week onward, the board wasn’t just wiped—it was spotless. There were no smudges, no chalk dust, and no leftover scribbles. The board looked fresh every morning, almost as if it were brand new. It became easier to read the content written on it, concentrate during lectures, and take accurate notes. I realized that something as simple as a clean board could drastically improve the learning experience. The cleaning staff did not just clean because I asked—they made it part of their routine. Week after week, the board remained neat without any reminders.

Their consistency deeply moved me. The staff could have easily forgotten my request amidst their long list of tasks, but they didn’t. They remembered. They made sure the board was clean before each class. They took pride in their work, even though they rarely received acknowledgment for it.

In today’s busy academic environment, we often forget to appreciate the people who make our everyday lives easier. We only notice the absence of cleanliness, not the presence of it. When the board is dirty, we complain. But when it is clean, we simply move on with our day. This experience taught me to notice the invisible efforts around me—to pause, acknowledge, and appreciate.

The cleaning staff does more than sweep floors or wipe boards. They create a comfortable environment that allows students and teachers to focus without distractions. Their work reflects dedication, patience, and care. They may not teach lessons directly, but they contribute silently to our learning.

Today, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the cleaning staff—not only for cleaning the board but for consistently making our classroom a better place to learn. Their contribution may be quiet, but the impact is powerful. A clean board isn’t just a surface to write on—it is a symbol of their care and commitment.Every time I walk into the classroom and see that spotless board, I am reminded that kindness does not always announce itself loudly. Sometimes, it arrives quietly, through simple actions, from people who work behind the scenes. And for that, I am genuinely thankful.

Scenario 3
Date: 2 months ago
Whom: Shriyaa
In our daily routines, we often cross paths with people who make our lives easier without expecting anything in return. Their gestures may seem simple to them, yet they create significant impact for us. One such person in my life is my bus mate, Shriyaa. On a day when everything seemed to be going wrong and I was overwhelmed with worry, her quick thinking and willingness to help made all the difference. Today, I would like to thank her wholeheartedly for what she did.

It was an especially hectic day on campus. My team and I had an important discussion scheduled with our mentor regarding SIH — Smart India Hackathon. This discussion was crucial because we needed to finalize our idea, divide responsibilities, and plan the next steps. I remember feeling slightly tense yet excited, knowing that the discussion would influence how we progressed with our project. Once the meeting began, the conversation grew intense and deeply engaging. We bounced ideas back and forth, reviewed every detail, and made sure all perspectives were considered. Our mentor guided us patiently, and my team members contributed valuable inputs. The time slipped by without our noticing — what felt like a few minutes was actually more than an hour.

It was only after the discussion ended that I looked at my watch and realized the gravity of the situation. The shuttle bus that takes us from the campus buildings to the main bus parking area had already left. Panic rushed through me instantly. I wasn’t just late — I was extremely late. The thought of missing the evening bus back home filled me with anxiety. As a day scholar, the bus is my lifeline. Missing it meant figuring out an alternative at the last second, worrying my parents, and enduring a tiring journey back home. All of these thoughts flooded my mind at once.

I grabbed my things and hurried toward the shuttle parking area, hoping by some miracle that the shuttle might still be there. But the spot was empty. The campus suddenly felt much larger than usual, and every minute felt like it was slipping away. The long walk from the academic block to the main bus parking area would take too much time. If I started walking, I was certain I would miss the bus.

In that moment of confusion and worry, one thought flashed in my mind — call Shriyaa.

Shriyaa is not just a bus mate; she is one of my very good friends. We travel together every day, share conversations, laugh about small things, and complain about how tired we are after long classes. Without wasting a second, I dialed her number. My voice was uneven as I quickly explained the situation, telling her that I missed the shuttle and that I might not reach the bus parking on time. Before I could even finish speaking, she responded with complete confidence and determination — “Don’t worry. I will tell the driver to wait.”

Within moments, she took action. She walked straight to the bus driver and explained the situation, politely requesting him to wait for a few more minutes. I wasn’t there to see it, but I could imagine her speaking firmly and convincingly, because that is the kind of person she is — someone who steps up when help is needed.

Meanwhile, I ran toward the parking area as fast as I could, fueled by hope and gratitude. My heart was racing, and every step felt like a race against time. I kept praying silently, wishing the bus would still be there when I arrived.

And then, just as I turned the corner, I saw it — the bus was still waiting.

The relief I felt at that moment is hard to put into words. I reached the bus out of breath, exhausted, but filled with gratitude. As I climbed in, the first thing I did was look at Shriyaa. She gave me a simple, reassuring smile — not expecting recognition, not proud of what she did, just genuinely happy that I made it.

If it were not for her quick response and her willingness to help, I would have certainly missed the bus that day. Her timely intervention saved me from a lot of stress. What struck me the most was how effortless she made it seem. She didn’t say, “Let me see what I can do,” or “I’m busy.” Instead, she immediately took responsibility for the situation and acted.

In that small moment, I understood something bigger — friendship isn’t always about grand gestures; sometimes it’s about being present exactly when someone needs you.

Shriyaa’s gesture reminded me that we are never alone when we have people who care. She could have easily decided not to get involved. She could have assumed that I would manage on my own. But she didn’t. She went out of her way to make sure I didn’t struggle.

Today, when I think about that incident, I feel grateful not just because she helped me catch the bus, but because she showed me what support truly looks like. It is a beautiful feeling to know that someone is looking out for you, especially on days when everything feels overwhelming.
