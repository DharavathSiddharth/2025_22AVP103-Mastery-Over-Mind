SCENARIO 1 — August 6 | My Roommates
When I first moved into my hostel, I honestly didn’t know what to expect. Everyone kept telling me that hostel life would be one of the most memorable parts of college, but in those first few days, all I felt was nervousness and confusion. I was in a completely new environment — a new state, new people, a different routine, and no familiar faces around me. I still remember standing in my room on the very first day, looking at my luggage and wondering if I would ever feel comfortable there.
But as time went by, things started changing — not because I suddenly became more confident, but because of the people around me: my roommates. They were the ones who made the biggest difference in helping me adjust to this new phase of life. We all started as complete strangers, but slowly, the room became our shared home — a place where laughter, learning, and late-night conversations filled the gaps that homesickness left behind.At first, it was a little awkward. We didn’t know much about each other, and everyone was still trying to settle down. The first few conversations were mostly practical — about charging points, locker space, and mess timings. But as the days passed, we started talking more freely. Someone would crack a joke, another person would share a story from their hometown, and before long, those small talks turned into real conversations. That’s how our friendship started — not suddenly, but naturally.What I appreciated the most was that everyone brought something different to the room. One of my roommates was always organized — everything in his space had a fixed position. Another one was easygoing and funny, the kind of person who could make anyone laugh even when we were stressed. One was serious about studies but still made time to help others with assignments. And then there were moments when all of us would just forget about everything else and start laughing over the most random things.Adjusting to hostel life taught me one major lesson: understanding and respecting differences. We all came from different backgrounds — different languages, habits, and lifestyles. Naturally, there were times when our routines clashed. Someone would stay up late studying, while another preferred sleeping early. Sometimes, music played loudly from one corner while someone else wanted silence. But instead of fighting, we learned to compromise. We talked things out, set small rules for the room, and respected each other’s comfort zones. That’s when I realized that adjustment doesn’t mean losing your comfort — it means finding balance.There were also times when one of us wasn’t in the best mood — maybe due to classes, marks, or missing home. Those were the moments that showed how strong our bond had become. No one would say much, but someone would crack a joke or suggest going for tea near the hostel gate, and that would lighten the atmosphere immediately. Just being around each other was enough to feel better.I can still remember one night when we all sat talking until almost 2 a.m., not about studies or college, but about our lives — our school experiences, families, and what we wanted to do in the future. It was during that conversation that I realized how lucky I was to have these people around me. They weren’t just roommates — they had become friends who genuinely cared.Of course, there were also funny and chaotic moments. Once, one of my roommates tried to cook Maggi on a small electric coil we weren’t supposed to use, and the smell spread through the corridor. Another time, the fan stopped working in the middle of summer, and we ended up sitting in the corridor talking to pass time. It’s those small, random experiences that make hostel life what it is — full of unpredictability and laughter.
Living together also taught me a lot about responsibility. Keeping the room clean, managing time, and helping each other out became part of our routine. We developed an unspoken teamwork — if one person forgot to turn off the lights, another would do it; if someone fell sick, we’d make sure they had food and medicine. These weren’t big gestures, but they made life smoother and built mutual trust.Now, when I look back, I realize how much I’ve grown because of this experience. I came into the hostel unsure and uncomfortable, but my roommates made me feel included. They showed me that friendship doesn’t always need to be loud or dramatic — sometimes it’s built through shared meals, late-night study sessions, and small acts of care.
If I ever meet a junior joining college for the first time, I’d tell them not to worry too much about how they’ll adjust. Because more often than not, it’s the people you meet — like your roommates — who make you feel at home. I’ll always be grateful for the people I met in that room. They helped me find balance, patience, and confidence in this new chapter of life.

SCENARIO 2 — August 10 | Mr. Saurabh Srivatsav
When I think about the people who’ve had a strong impact on my college life so far, one person who immediately comes to mind is Mr. Saurabh Srivatsav, our Cybersecurity faculty. Before joining college, I was unsure if I had chosen the right branch. Cybersecurity sounded interesting, but also intimidating — full of technical terms, coding, and complex concepts. I had a basic idea of what it was, but I didn’t know whether I’d actually enjoy studying it. That changed completely after attending Mr. Saurabh’s first class.The first thing that struck me about him was his calm and composed presence. He didn’t need to raise his voice or try to impress the class — his clarity and confidence did that automatically. The way he explained each topic was simple yet meaningful. He didn’t just teach definitions; he connected the concepts to real-world scenarios, showing us why they mattered. For example, when he talked about online safety, he didn’t just explain encryption or firewalls; he spoke about human responsibility in protecting digital spaces. That’s when I realized that cybersecurity isn’t just about machines — it’s about people, ethics, and trust.
As the classes went on, I started looking forward to them. There was something about his teaching style that made you want to learn more. Even complicated topics felt approachable because of how he broke them down. He never made anyone feel small for asking questions — instead, he encouraged it. That classroom environment helped me build confidence to express my thoughts and doubts openly.But what impressed me even more was his discipline. He was always punctual, well-prepared, and focused. Watching him made me understand that professionalism isn’t something you learn overnight — it’s built through consistency. The way he carried himself taught me that expertise comes with both knowledge and character.One day, I stayed back after class to ask him about a concept I didn’t fully understand. Instead of giving me a short answer, he patiently explained it from the basics, using a simple real-life analogy. That conversation stayed with me because it showed how dedicated he was to his students’ understanding, not just to finishing the syllabus.Over time, his classes became one of the main reasons I started developing a deep interest in cybersecurity. I began reading articles, watching videos, and exploring tools outside the curriculum — not because I had to, but because I genuinely wanted to. His way of teaching didn’t just fill my notebook; it shaped how I thought about the field.Another thing I admired was how he never made the class about himself. He didn’t show off his knowledge or make things overly complex. His focus was always on ensuring that every student grasped the concept and understood its importance. That humility, combined with his expertise, made a strong impression on me.I now realize how crucial a good teacher can be in shaping your attitude toward a subject. Before his class, cybersecurity was just a term for me. After his class, it became a passion. Whenever I feel confused about what direction to take in my studies, I think back to how his words simplified everything — “Cybersecurity is about protecting what matters.”That one sentence completely changed how I look at my field. It’s not just about coding or hacking — it’s about responsibility. And I’ll always be thankful to him for helping me see that.

SCENARIO 3 — October 22 | The Security Guard
There are certain moments that remind you how kindness can come from the most unexpected places. One such moment for me happened on October 22, with the security guard at the main gate. It might sound like a simple story, but that day taught me a lot about patience, humanity, and how small acts can make a huge difference.It was around 8:15 PM, and I was waiting near the gate for a delivery — my new cycle. I was excited but also nervous because the hostel gate closes by 9 PM, and the delivery person was running late. To make things more stressful, there was a language barrier since I didn’t know Tamil well enough to communicate clearly. The delivery driver couldn’t find the right location, and I was struggling to explain where the hostel gate was. I could feel the minutes ticking by, and my anxiety rising.That’s when the security guard noticed my situation. He could’ve easily ignored it — after all, it wasn’t his responsibility. But instead, he came over and asked me what was wrong. I tried to explain the issue in a mix of English and broken Tamil, and he immediately understood. Without hesitation, he took my phone, called the delivery person, and started speaking in Tamil, giving clear directions.Even after that, he stayed with me. He didn’t just leave after helping once — he waited beside me until the cycle actually arrived. He stood there, making sure everything went smoothly. When the courier truck finally reached, he helped check the package, ensured that it was properly unloaded, and even verified that I received it safely.What stood out to me most wasn’t just the help itself, but the way he did it — with calmness and patience. He wasn’t rushing, he wasn’t irritated, and he didn’t expect any appreciation. It was pure kindness. In that moment, I realized that genuine goodness doesn’t need an audience. It’s quiet and simple.I thanked him multiple times, but he just smiled and said, “No problem, it’s okay.” That small exchange stayed with me long after the incident. It made me appreciate how often we overlook people who quietly make our lives easier — like the guards, cleaners, and other staff who ensure everything runs smoothly.That night changed my perspective. The security guard didn’t just help me get my delivery; he reminded me of the value of empathy and community. His action might have seemed small, but for me, it meant a lot. It showed me that being helpful doesn’t require status or power — it just needs a good heart.Even now, whenever I see him at the gate, I greet him with respect and a smile. It’s my small way of acknowledging what he did for me that evening. That experience made me more observant of the people around me — the ones who quietly play their part in making life on campus better for everyone.If that security guard hadn’t stepped in that night, I would have been lost and stressed. Instead, he handled everything calmly and ensured I was okay. That act of kindness will always stay in my memory.
