## Journal Record

1.Yashwanth (Senior)

I feel truly grateful to my senior, Yashwanth, whose presence during the college hackathon became one of the most meaningful experiences of my journey. When our team decided to participate, I was both excited and nervous. We had enthusiasm, but not much direction. That’s when Yashwanth stepped in — not as a supervisor, but as a mentor and motivator.

He had a calm and encouraging way of explaining things. Whenever we were stuck or uncertain, he would patiently listen, help us refocus, and guide us toward simple yet effective solutions. I remember how he constantly reminded us that teamwork mattered more than competition. His belief in our abilities pushed me to overcome my fear of failure.

What made his guidance special was the way he taught through experience. Instead of giving ready-made answers, he helped us discover them ourselves. Every interaction with him taught me something new — not only about coding or logic, but about how to stay composed under pressure and how to keep moving forward when things don’t go as planned.

Even though he was a senior, he never made us feel lesser. He spoke to us like equals, appreciating our ideas and encouraging us to explore them further. After the hackathon, I realized how much confidence I had gained simply because he trusted us. His mentorship helped me believe that success isn’t only about winning; it’s about learning and growing through every challenge.

To this day, I feel grateful for the time, patience, and positivity he shared with us. Yashwanth taught me what true leadership looks like — not through authority, but through humility and encouragement.

2.Watchman

Gratitude often comes from the simplest moments, and one person who truly deserves mine is our college watchman. Though his job seems ordinary, his kindness and helpful nature have made a real difference in my college life.

Whenever someone new enters the campus, he is always the first to offer help. I still remember how many times he guided me when I was lost, patiently showing the way to classrooms, labs, and events. He never hesitates, no matter how busy he is. His directions are always clear, and his friendly attitude makes every interaction warm and respectful.

Beyond his role, he has a genuine sense of care for everyone. There were times when I stayed late on campus, and he would always make sure I was safe or remind me not to skip meals. It’s these small gestures that show how deeply he values the students he interacts with every day.

He has taught me an important lesson — that no act of kindness is too small. His discipline, punctuality, and humble personality inspire me to stay grounded. People like him often go unnoticed, yet their contribution keeps everything functioning smoothly.

Every time I greet him now, it comes from a place of respect and appreciation. I’ve learned that gratitude doesn’t always belong to big achievements; sometimes, it’s about acknowledging the everyday heroes who make our lives easier. For me, our watchman is one such hero — a good navigator not only of places, but of people’s hearts.


3.Rohini Mam (Faculty Mentor)

I owe deep gratitude to Rohini Ma’am, who played a crucial role during our hackathon journey. She was not only a guide but also a constant source of encouragement and clarity. Whenever our team faced challenges or confusion, she was the one who helped us regain focus.

Her way of teaching went beyond technical knowledge. She encouraged us to think practically, to question why we were building something, and to make sure our ideas could create real impact. Her guidance helped us structure our thoughts and express our concepts confidently.

What stood out most was her supportive nature. She treated every student equally, listened to our doubts patiently, and motivated us to work harder without fear of failure. Even when things didn’t go as planned, she reminded us that learning mattered more than perfection. That perspective completely changed the way I look at challenges.

Her trust in our abilities gave me the confidence to take initiative and think creatively. I learned that a good mentor doesn’t just instruct — they inspire. The kindness and positivity she carried through every interaction made me realize how much difference one encouraging teacher can make in a student’s life.

Every time I think about that experience, I feel thankful for her presence and guidance. Rohini Ma’am taught me that true success lies not only in achievement, but in the passion and effort we put into what we do.
