# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind



## Journal Record

	

 I wish to formally express my sincere gratitude to my Cybersecurity (CYS) teacher, Saurabh Sir. When I initially joined the CYS class, I was extremely apprehensive because I had made a significant decision: I chose to pursue Cybersecurity out of my personal interest, even though my parents had different expectations about my academic direction. Entering the classroom for the first time, I remember feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety. I was uncertain whether I had made the right choice or would be able to keep up with the demands of the course. However, as the weeks progressed under your guidance, my fears began to dissipate, replaced by a sense of confidence and belonging.

Your teaching style, encouragement, and approachable nature have played a very significant role in this transformation. The way you break down complex topics into concepts that are easily understood has built a strong foundation in me, and I now feel thoroughly prepared to face any academic challenge that comes my way. You always motivate us toward thinking, finding solutions, and cultivating a love for learning—a trait that will surely see me through my B.Tech journey. Beyond academics, whenever the feeling of low self-confidence would creep in, your support and steadfast belief in my potential really made me believe in myself. For this, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

I would also like to extend my deep and sincere appreciation to the hostel cleaning staff. Keeping the hostel clean is not an easy task, as sometimes some of the students are not responsible enough and tend to leave common areas unclean. Despite facing such daily challenges, the staff members work with dedication, patience, and a positive spirit. Their efforts, which often go unseen, help create a pleasant and healthy environment for all of us. I have especially noted how they handle situations after celebrations or events, such as birthday parties, in which corridors and other places were left messy. This extra load did not deter them from restoring order and allowed us to return to a neat and comfortable living space. Their commitment has instilled in me a newly found respect for what they do and the important role they play in our lives here on campus. I am really grateful for their hard work and would like to acknowledge their support and service continuously.

I am also very grateful to our class advisor, Praveen Sir. During and after our mid-semester examinations, our CYS B section faced many problems, both academic and personal. Many of us, like me, became dejected at the marks received, which were perceived to be lower than expected, or at the expectation that more was required of them. During this period, when the self-respect of every student was really low, Sir's words were a motivation to carry on and to learn how to sustain disappointment with grace. He reminds us that failures and disappointments are a part of the learning process and that we can use every experience in order to better ourselves. His guidance, kind words, and readiness to listen to our problems have made lasting impressions on my mind. I shall always consider myself lucky that his mentorship has made me grow not only in character but also to face the adversities thrown up by life with greater resolve.


Lastly, I would like to thank Saurabh Sir, the hostel cleaning staff, and Praveen Sir with all my heart for their continuous support, encouragement, and dedication. Their efforts have made my academic life richer and given me the foundation and confidence to overcome any hurdle that comes my way.
