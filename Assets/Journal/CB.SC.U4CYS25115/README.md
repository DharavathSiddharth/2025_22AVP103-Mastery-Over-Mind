# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
**Scenario 1:**-

I want to express my gratitude to my friend Srihas, who sits beside me in class. From the very beginning of my journey in Amrita, whenever I have faced any difficulty in understanding something, he would patiently explain to me in a very simple manner, without any hesitation.

I still remember one day in math class, when I could not understand a particular problem. I  asked him multiple times, and without any anger or frustration, he explained it to me again and again. What I admire most in him is his patience and willingness to help others.

He never makes me feel silly for not understanding something. His help has made me feel more confident in the class. I am really lucky to have him as my friend. He is a very kind person who truly cares about  people. His support has made my whole journey in Amrita much better.

He is smart, but he is also humble and approachable. He always makes sure I have understood before moving on. It is great to have someone who sits beside me who is trustworthy and we can depend on him. His positive attitude makes even difficult classes easier. I have learned just as much from his kindness as I have from his explanations.





**Scenario 2:**

I want to express my gratitude to my friend Sahith. He has helped me countless times by lending me money whenever I need it. No matter the situation, he never hesitates. He would always say, “We are going to stay here together for four years — you can repay me anytime.” That simple line shows me how generous and understanding he is.



One of my favorite memories was with him, during our midterm exams. I was used to spending the whole day in his room, studying together. His calm presence and focus helped me stay motivated. What I like most about Sahith is his kindness, patience, and the way he always makes others feel supported.



He never made me feel bad for asking for help. He trusts me a lot in any situation, and i also have the same trust in him. Studying with him made difficult exams feel easier. He is just a genuine  and good person who looks out for his friends.



gHe is just a genuine and ood person who looks out for his friends. His support has been a huge part of my college life. He always shares what he has without a second thought, and i also share everything with him, every point. I always felt comfortable coming into his room. Getting a friend like him is one of the best things that has happened to me and in my life. He does not only talk like a good friend; he proves it. I really appreciate how he always stays positive with everyone and in any situation, even during stressful exams.I have learned a lot from him about being a calm and focused person. He’s the kind of person you can trust, no matter what. My college experience would not be the same without him.







I’m lucky to have a friend like him.



**Scenario 3:**

I want to express my gratitude to my roommate, Sridhar. He has always been there to help me, especially when it comes to booking the train tickets. Every time I needed his help.



I still remember the time of Dussehra, when we suddenly got two extra days of holiday. I couldn't find any train to travel to Visakhapatnam, but at that time Sridhar had helped me a lot in booking the ticket for me to go home. That moment I really felt his helpfulness.



And that is just one example. He is the only person I am stressed about exams or just need someone to talk to - he is always understanding and ready to listen and talk.

He never makes me feel like I am bothering him or disturbing him at any time, no matter what I am asking him. i know that in any situation of my life, there is one person who can help me. He is one of the most balanced people I have ever met. He makes me feel like he is my family member, and , when i am far away from my family, at that time, I feel that I am still with my family members. He makes the hostel room feel more like a home.He is good at solving any problem, like those train ticket bookings. If someone needs any help from him, he will help them out without expecting anything in return from that person. His calm attitude helps me feel less stressed out too. i am very happy to have such a friend. He’s not just a roommate; he’s a truly good friend.



I truly appreciate his kindness and his selfless nature. He’s always ready to help anyone without any greed. Having a roommate like him has made my hostel life so much happier, and I'm just really thankful to have him as a friend.

""I can't say in words how important they are in my life.""
