## Journal Record
THREE INSTANCES OF PEOPLE HELPING ME IN AMRITA:

1. Gratitude for SriNavya:

The day started off like any other, smooth until small choices turned into memorable stories. It was mid-October in Coimbatore, one of those mornings when the sky looks clear but hints at rain. I left my hostel with my assignments, laptop, and misplaced confidence that I wouldn’t need my umbrella. I had a cybersecurity paper to finish by evening, so I planned to work in the staff room where the Wi-Fi was reliable and the distractions were minimal.

By noon, everything shifted. The sunlight vanished behind thick grey clouds, and the rain began slowly at first, then poured down in sheets that blurred the world outside. I watched through the glass window as the quadrangle flooded within minutes. Students with umbrellas dashed across campus, bright dots against the gloomy sky, while others sought cover wherever they could. The staff room felt smaller in the sudden chill, and the smell of wet earth drifted in through the vents. My phone buzzed with a weather alert—a warning for heavy rainfall and potential flooding in low areas.

I tried to concentrate on the code I was debugging, but then I remembered my clothes were still hanging on the hostel balcony. The rain showed no mercy; I could almost see my half-dry shirts succumbing to the storm. Leaving wasn’t an option since the corridors were already filled with water. I didn’t even have my umbrella. Each solution felt unreachable, and I felt increasingly trapped with my own thoughts. 

I texted Navya on impulse. She was in the same hostel, and we had grown closer through late nights working on projects and sharing dinners in the canteen. “Hey, it’s raining hard. Clothes outside. No umbrella,” I typed, hoping for sympathy but expecting just a kind “oh no.” Instead, her response was, “Don’t worry. I’ll check.”

Ten minutes passed, and the rain pounded harder against the windows. Then, a message came through: “Got them! I’m coming with your umbrella.” My heart raced in disbelief. She was venturing out into the rain? It seemed impossible. But fifteen minutes later, to my astonishment, I saw a figure under a maroon umbrella at the entrance of the staff wing.

It was Navya, her hair wet, shoes soaked. She smiled as if it was nothing unusual and handed me my umbrella. “You should at least have this,” she said, chuckling softly. “And don’t worry about your clothes—they’re safe.”

I felt my throat tighten. It wasn’t just relief—it was her kindness. She navigated half the campus, through flooded walkways and heavy rain, just to save my things and ensure I wouldn’t wait helplessly. Her kindness was unwavering. That kind of care doesn’t shout; it quietly moves through inconvenience.

As we stood there discussing the awful weather, the power flickered on and off, adding an odd glow to the room. Time slowed a bit. I thought about how simple moments like this redefine friendship—not through constant presence, but through one thoughtful act that stays with you well after the rain stops.

Later that evening, when I returned to the hostel, my clothes were neatly folded on my bed. She had gone to the trouble of spinning them dry. That act stuck with me, not because it was grand, but because it was so human. Kindness, I realized, often appears unexpectedly in those who quietly care for you when you least anticipate it.

That day, gratitude wasn’t merely a feeling—it became a lesson in noticing small gestures amid storms, both literal and metaphorical.

2. Gratitude for SriVarshini

The morning was hazy; the sky felt heavy with the stillness before a headache. I had stayed up late reviewing network security protocols, and my stomach hurt from too much coffee and too little food. When I walked into class, the projector buzzed and sleepy students murmured, blending into a dull hum. My seatmate, Srivarshini, greeted me with her usual calm smile, but I barely returned it.

She noticed before anyone else did. That's just her nature—observant, quiet, yet incredibly aware. She looked at me as I sat down sluggishly and asked, “Did you eat?” I shook my head, brushing it off. But my face must have shown everything. Minutes later, dizziness began creeping in. The words on the board swayed, and my pen slipped from my fingers more than once. The world dissolved into a blur of noise.

When class ended, I lingered at my desk, pretending to check something on my laptop. Moments later, she stood beside me and said, “Just wait here.” Without another word, she stepped out. I didn’t question her—my energy was too low for that.

Ten minutes later, she returned with a steaming paper cup. The faint aroma told me what it was even before she softly said, “Sugar coffee. You’ll feel better.” I hesitated, but she pushed it closer. “Take it. I know what it’s like to run on empty.”

I took a sip, and warmth spread through my chilled body. It wasn’t just caffeine or sugar—it was the feeling of being seen. The classroom was quiet, sunlight filtering through the blinds like thin gold threads. She sat beside me while I finished the cup, not talking much or asking questions. Her quiet presence was soothing, showing that care doesn’t always need words.

Later, I learned she skipped her own break to get that coffee from another block since the nearby canteen was closed. That effort—small yet thoughtful—deeply impacted me. In that moment, gratitude meant more than I could express.

She reminded me that true kindness often hides in simple moments. The way she noticed without prompting an explanation, acted without expecting thanks, and cared without making a fuss—it softened something within me.

That single act shifted my understanding of empathy. I began to pay closer attention—to tone, body language, and unspoken discomfort. She showed me that even simple gestures—a cup of coffee, a word of support—can transform someone's whole day. For me, it turned a tough morning into a quiet reminder that someone noticed, and that was enough.

3. Gratitude for a Stranger’s Kindness

That night, campus life bustled in its usual rhythm after study sessions. The canteen buzzed with students grabbing late meals—instant noodles, juice boxes, and greasy sandwiches. I queued for a plate of dosa and tea, fumbling with my wallet while half-watching cricket highlights on the screen overhead. By the time it was my turn, drizzle had begun outside, the smell of wet earth wafting through the open doorway.

After eating, I hurried out to the hostel to finish some leftover work. Only half an hour later, while searching through my backpack, I realized my cash pouch was missing. My heart raced. I had withdrawn some money that evening for lab supplies, and though it wasn’t a fortune, losing it stung. I dashed back to the canteen, my heart pounding. But the queue had changed, with new faces everywhere. I checked the counter—nothing.

Just as I was about to lose hope, someone tapped my shoulder. “Are you in the computer science batch?” I turned to see a girl holding my pouch. She was from another department—I vaguely recognized her from the digital circuit lab corridor. “You left this near the water counter,” she said, slightly out of breath. “I saw you leaving and thought you might need it back. I had to find someone who knew your name.”

I was taken aback. She could have easily kept it; there were no witnesses, no identification. And yet here she was, returning something she had no obligation to. I stammered out my thanks, but she brushed it off lightly. “It happens. Just be careful next time.” Then she smiled and walked away before I could say anything more.

That brief encounter stayed with me long afterward. It wasn’t just her honesty; it was her willingness to go out of her way to find me. She could have chosen indifference. But she didn’t. And that made all the difference.

Later that night, as I resumed work, I realized something: we often underestimate how much small acts of integrity matter. The world may seem self-centered, but sometimes, a stranger’s kindness can shake that cynicism. Her honesty renewed my quiet belief that goodness doesn’t always need acknowledgment; sometimes it just wants to do the right thing in silence.

Every time I recall that night, I recall not only the pouch that was returned but also the calm, kind, and effortlessly sincere look on her face.  She most likely forgot about it the following day, but for me, her deed served as a constant reminder that good deeds can still be found in unexpected and peaceful places.
