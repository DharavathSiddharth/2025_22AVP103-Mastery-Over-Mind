# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind
Scenario 1
Date-aug 24
whom-Bharath
when i joined the campus, Bharath is the kind of person who’s always there when i need him. He helps everyone without expecting anything in return.Bharath has a great sense of humor  he can make anyone laugh and keeps the group lively all the time. Bharath is patient and listens to everyone. He gives honest advice and never judges others.. We’ve known each other since 7th standard, so seeing him here felt like a piece of home. He’s the same as ever — friendly, funny, and always ready to help anyone.Bharath is the kind of person you can rely on without thinking twice. If I’m stuck with a project, he’s there. If I’m having a bad day, he somehow knows exactly what to say to make me laugh. There’s something about him — a kind of calm energy that keeps everyone around him comfortable.What I like most about him is his humor. He doesn’t just crack random jokes; he knows how to lift the mood when things get stressful. Even during our coding sessions or late-night study marathons, he’ll throw in a line or two that gets everyone laughing. The stress just disappears for a bit, and suddenly the work feels easier.We’ve been through so many phases together — school days filled with cricket, teasing teachers, and endless laughs, to college days full of assignments, hackathons, and hostel chaos. Even after all these years, our friendship hasn’t changed. We may have grown up, but our bond still has that same childhood simplicity.
One thing that really stands out about Bharath is how patient he is. He never gets angry easily, and he listens. Like, really listens. If I have a problem, he doesn’t just say “it’ll befine” — he actually helps me figure it out. Once, when I was stressing over a project, he stayed with me till midnight just so I wouldn’t give up. He didn’t need to do that, but he did, without even making a big deal out of it.

He’s honest too. If I mess up, he’ll tell me directly — not to put me down, but to help me do better. His honesty has made me stronger and more self-aware. It’s hard to find people like that now.I think the best part about our friendship is that it feels effortless. We don’t need to talk every day or share every detail of our lives. Even if we go a while without seeing each other, when we meet, it’s like nothing changed.Looking back, I realize how lucky I am to have a friend like Bharath. He’s more than a friend — he’s like family. Someone who’s been there from school memories to college dreams, through every small win and loss. I know that even years from now, when college ends and life gets busy, this bond will still stay strong. Because real friendships like ours don’t fade — they just keep growing quietly in the background.Sometimes we sit quietly at the canteen or just walk around campus talking about random things — from school memories to future dreams. He wants to become someone successful in tech, not just for money, but to make something meaningful. That’s another thing I respect about him — he dreams big but stays grounded.

Because real friendships like ours don’t fade — they just keep growing quietly in the background.Over time, I’ve come to realize how much of a positive influence he’s been in my life. There’s something reassuring about knowing that no matter what happens, he’s one message away. During exams, he’s the one reminding everyone to stay calm; during festivals, he’s the one planning celebrations; during tough times, he’s the one reminding us that everything will eventually be okay.

Sometimes, when we sit under the campus trees after class, we talk about how far we’ve come since school — from those simple days of running around in uniforms to facing real-world responsibilities. It’s funny, but even now, the comfort of his friendship feels the same.


Scenario 2
Date-sep 1
whom-MaOM Sir 
When i attended the cys orientation, He explained about overthinking, how it makes our mind restless and showed us ways to keep our brain calm and focused. His words always carry wisdom and positivity. And he also give motivation to participate in hackthon and other events also.He explained it in such a simple yet powerful way that it left a deep impact on me. He said something that stuck with me: “Your brain is like a browser with too many tabs open. You can’t think clearly until you close the unnecessary ones.”
He spoke about something we all silently struggle with — overthinking. The way he described it made so much sense. He said, “Your brain is like a browser with too many tabs open. You can’t think clearly until you close a few.” That line hit me hard. It was simple, but it explained exactly what I felt sometimes — the way thoughts pile up, how small worries grow big, and how that messes with peace of mind.He didn’t just tell us that overthinking is bad — he showed us how to deal with it. He spoke about mindfulness, focus, and learning to control what we can. He even gave practical advice — like taking deep breaths when our mind gets crowded or spending a few minutes in silence every day to reset.

I remember sitting there, genuinely listening, not because I had to, but because I wanted to. His way of speaking had warmth — not like a teacher scolding students, but like a mentor guiding us through life.Since that day, I’ve tried to follow what he said. Whenever I catch myself spiraling into unnecessary thoughts, I remind myself of his words — to pause, breathe, and focus on what’s real. It’s made a difference.But MaOM Sir isn’t just about teaching mental calmness. He also encourages us to grow beyond the classroom. He constantly motivates us to join hackathons, take part in projects, and push ourselves out of comfort zones. He believes in learning through doing, not just memorizing.
What I admire most is how approachable he is. You can talk to him about anything — studies, stress, or even personal worries — and he listens without judgment. His words always carry positivity, and somehow, even when things seem hard, he makes you believe they’ll be okay.He’s more than a faculty member; he’s a mentor whose influence stays long after the lecture ends. His words don’t just fill notebooks — they stay in your thoughts, shaping how you see life and yourself. Every time I feel restless or doubtful, I think of his calm tone during that orientation, reminding me that peace isn’t found outside — it starts in the mind.I remember sitting there, genuinely listening, not because I had to, but because I wanted to.

He constantly motivates us to join hackathons, take part in projects, and push ourselves out of comfort zones. He believes in learning through doing, not just memorizing.He often says that success doesn’t come from grades alone, but from discipline, curiosity, and courage. That mindset has changed how I approach studies. Instead of worrying about marks, I now focus on learning. That’s something I truly owe to him.
once after class, I asked him how he manages to stay so calm all the time. He smiled and said, “It’s not that I don’t have stress; I just stopped giving energy to things I can’t control.” That simple answer taught me more about emotional strength than any motivational video ever could.What I admire most is how approachable he is.

What makes him stand out is the way he connects with students. Sometimes, he shares stories from his own life — times when he struggled, made mistakes, or faced setbacks. Hearing that from a teacher gives us strength because it reminds us that everyone starts somewhere.

One day, after class, I had a short talk with him about feeling lost in choosing my goals. He simply said, “Don’t rush it. Focus on learning one thing deeply. The rest will follow.” That sentence gave me clarity and stopped me from comparing myself to others.He’s not just teaching us about cybersecurity or academics; he’s shaping our mindset — how to handle stress, how to stay consistent, and how to be kind to ourselves. Every college needs a teacher like him — someone who can see potential in students even when they can’t see it themselves.
Whenever I think about my journey so far, I realize how lucky I was to attend that orientation session. It changed how I think, how I manage my time, and how I approach life. I’ll always be grateful to MaOM Sir for teaching me that peace of mind and focus are just as important as grades.
Sometimes, when we sit under the campus trees after class, we talk about how far we’ve come since school — from those simple days of running around in uniforms to facing real-world responsibilities. It’s funny, but even now, the comfort of his friendship feels the same.




Scenario 3
Date-aug 
whom - roommates
we share everything from food to fun. Living with them has taught me friendship, patience, and teamwork. We may fight sometimes, but our bond always stays strong. They make hostel life enjoyable and full of good vibes.Hostel life would never have been this fun without my four roommates. We share everything — from food to laughter, from stress to silly jokes. Each of them has a unique personality, and together, we make an unforgettable team. Living with them has taught me lessons that go beyond textbooks — about patience, sharing, and real friendship.
Every night feels like a mini adventure. Sometimes we stay up late studying for exams, surrounded by open laptops, snacks, and music. Other times, we end up having deep late-night talks about life, dreams, or random funny memories. There are days when the room turns into a study zone, and days when it feels like a comedy club.
of course, we fight too — about small things like who didn’t refill the water bottle or who used someone’s shampoo without asking. But no matter what, the fights never last. The bond we share is stronger than any argument. By the next hour, we’re laughing together again, planning what to order from Swiggy or deciding which movie to watch.
being with them taught me teamwork and understanding. Everyone contributes in their own way — one handles cleaning, another cooks, someone arranges notes, and another cracks jokes to keep us sane. Together, we’ve built an environment that feels like a second home.
Some of my best memories in college are tied to those simple hostel moments — group studies before deadlines, celebrating birthdays with midnight cake smashes, laughing so hard that we forget our stress. These are the people who make even the toughest days manageable.

Over time, I realized that roommates aren’t just people you share a room with — they become your family away from home. Each day with them adds a small story to the big chapter of my college life. And when I look back, I know that the laughter, friendship, and late-night talks we shared will always remain some of my favorite memories.The best part of hostel life, though, is the late-night talks. Those random conversations that start with “just five minutes” and end at 3 a.m. We talk about everything — our families, dreams, fears, crushes, and sometimes just nonsense that makes no sense but still feels good.We’ve had fights too — small ones over snacks or someone not cleaning their side of the room. But honestly, those fights never last. We can’t stay angry for long. Someone always cracks a joke or plays a meme that breaks the tension, and then we’re back to laughing again.
We also help each other grow. One of my roommates is a genius at coding, another is organized and keeps track of deadlines, one is hilarious and keeps us light-hearted, and another is the calm thinker who resolves our fights. Being around them taught me teamwork in the best way.We’ve created a routine — evening snacks together, late-night maggi, group studies, and small celebrations for even the tiniest things. Hostel birthdays are the best — messy, loud, full of laughter, and unforgettable.Over time, these guys have become my family here. They’re the ones I eat with, study with, laugh with, and sometimes even cry with. They’ve seen my best days and my worst ones, and they’ve never made me feel alone.

Living with them taught me a lot — patience, understanding, and how to find happiness in small things. It made me realize that friendship isn’t about being perfect; it’s about being there. And no matter how hectic college life gets, I know that when I step into that room at the end of the day, I’ll find peace, laughter, and people who truly get me.
Hostel life with them isn’t just a chapter — it’s a whole story, one I’ll remember long after I leave college. Because some bonds don’t end with time or distance; they become a part of who you are.One of my favorite memories is when we all stayed up the entire night before a hackathon. We didn’t even realize how tired we were because we were laughing, eating chips, and helping each other code. Even though we were exhausted, that night reminded me what friendship feels like — teamwork mixed with pure fun.

Hostel life with them isn’t just a chapter — it’s a whole story, one I’ll remember long after I leave college. Because the laughter, the fights, the silly jokes, and the shared dreams are what make this time unforgettable.
